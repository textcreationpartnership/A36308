         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">U</seg>Pon the Death of my Father Dr. <hi>Donne,</hi> ſometimes Deane of <hi>Pauls,</hi> I was ſent to, by his <hi>Majeſty of Bleſſed Memory,</hi> to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and publiſh his Sermons; I was encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by many of the Nobility, both <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> and <hi>Temporal,</hi> and indeed, by the moſt Eminent <hi>Men</hi> that the Kingdom then had, of all Profeſſions, telling me, what a publick good I ſhould confer upon the <hi>Church,</hi> and, that by this means I ſhould not only preach to all the Pariſhes of <hi>England,</hi> but to thoſe, whoſe Affairs carried them into Forraigne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; and to thoſe, whoſe infirmities did not ſuffer them to come to their own Churches at home, But, above all, I was encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the example of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who, though he took wages of other Churches, and yet ſerved the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf excuſable, in that, he was alwaies doing ſervice to the <hi>Church of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt Volume that I publiſhed, conſiſting of <hi>Fourſcore Sermons,</hi> I dedicated to his Majeſty then living, by whom, it was not only graciouſly received, but I had freſh Incouragements to proceed: For the Second Volume, I was forced to take Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from thoſe that were then in Authority, leſt (our duty to our King being ſo often, and ſo pathetically urged) they might have incurred the danger, Firſt, to have been voted <hi>No Sermons,</hi> and then, that <hi>No Sermons</hi> ſhould have bin burnt by the hand of the Publick Executioner; and, the uſe that might have bin made of them, by keeping up the Banks of the Church, againſt that Torrent of <hi>Heretiques,</hi> that did then invade her, might have been abſolutely defeated: for now began to ſwarme and muſter the <hi>Ebionites, Sabellians, Jovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Eutichians, Corpocratians, Sethians, Cerinthians, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotians, Nicolaitans, Samocetanians, Apolenarians, Montane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> all againſt the ſecond Perſon of the Trinity.</p>
            <p>And, although, in ſome parts of the <hi>World</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> may ſee the Men eating their god, and in ſix hours journey farther, he may ſee the gods eating the Men, though he may have beheld as many <hi>Religions,</hi> as he produced <hi>Inſects,</hi> yet he could tell us of no ſuch <hi>Python,</hi> as appeared here, who ſwallowing up all the other <hi>Heretiques,</hi> pretended that he himſelf was the very <hi>Son of
<pb facs="tcp:93368:4"/>
God;</hi> not knowing how dearly that <hi>Impoſter</hi> payed for it, that adventured upon that deſigne, but in the days of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth;</hi> for though it be true, <hi>That he that is baptized into Chriſt,</hi> may put on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> his <hi>Perſon,</hi> nay Him, ſo that <hi>God</hi> may take <hi>him</hi> for his own <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and look upon <hi>him,</hi> as <hi>all Mankinde;</hi> Yet, 'tis a hard matter to appear ſo before <hi>Man,</hi> for <hi>Homo homini daemon,</hi> we ſee nothing, we hear of nothing but the Imperfections of one another, and then we are not only content to ground our <hi>Faith</hi> upon ſlight <hi>Reports,</hi> but to believe, even Impoſſibilities.</p>
            <p>The People concluded <hi>Paul</hi> to be a <hi>Murderer,</hi> but firſt, they ſaw a <hi>Viper</hi> ſeize upon him after he had eſcaped Shipwrack; but ſtill proceeding upon new Evidence, when they ſaw him ſhake off that <hi>Viper,</hi> they ſaid he was a <hi>God;</hi> and certainly, though a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniator,</hi> with a two-edged tongue, ſharper and more venemous then the teeth of any <hi>Viper,</hi> may traduce the reputation of any man, ſo far as to make impreſſions upon ſome pious and godly perſons, yet if thoſe perſons would but retreat from thoſe ſuddain aſſaults unto thoſe <hi>Forts</hi> which their <hi>Charity</hi> may, nay, ought to erect, but to reaſonable Evidences; they may reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conclude, that if many thouſands were converted by <hi>one Sermon</hi> to the <hi>Chriſtian Faith;</hi> he that has ſpent ſo many years, in publiſhing ſo many Sermons for the propagation of that <hi>Faith,</hi> and preſerving the <hi>Light of that Goſpel,</hi> ſo as to dazle and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh thoſe <hi>New Lights,</hi> thoſe <hi>ignes fatuas,</hi> with their great Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>William-a-the-Wiſpe,</hi> (who drawing men, firſt out of the known paths, carries them into Boggs, Quagmires, and Whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pools of <hi>Confuſion</hi>) cannot poſſibly be but a well-<hi>grounded Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Jews intended the building of the Temple, their wiſe King <hi>Solomon</hi> ſent to <hi>Hiram</hi> many thouſand meaſures of corn, knowing that the <hi>Fellers</hi> of Timber, the <hi>hewers</hi> of ſtone, and thoſe that bore the burden, muſt be provided for, as well as the great <hi>Officers,</hi> the <hi>Overſeers. Fac hoc &amp; vives,</hi> was often repeated to me when I undertook this work, and a fair reward was promiſed me; but at laſt I am conſtrained, <hi>hoc facere ut vivam,</hi> to publiſh them at my own coſt that I may ſell them; which I had not been able to perform, if I had not been aſſiſted by the bounty of our moſt Honorable <hi>Lord Chancellor,</hi> (who is not only content, that the <hi>Churches</hi> ſhould be furniſhed with good <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> but that thoſe <hi>Preachers</hi> ſhould have good Sermons) and I am to reſt ſatisfied with that Text, that tells us, that <hi>To thoſe that have much, more ſhall be given; and to thoſe that have nothing</hi> (and there is nothing ſo near of kin to <hi>Nothing,</hi> as a Reverſion) that that they have ſhall be taken away.</p>
            <p>A better method (I confeſs) might have been obſerved in their Publication; whereby thoſe that are called to the ſervice

of private <hi>Churches,</hi> and have not the convenience of <hi>Publick Libraries,</hi> might have made more uſe of them, (for, I have ſeen many great Edifices, many noble Palaces erected without one ſtone taken out of the Quarry) but, ſo neer an Age, where <hi>Holy Confuſion</hi> is preſcribed to the Preacher, a little diſorder (I hope, Gentle Reader) may be pardoned in the Publiſher.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Text it ſelf is a Chriſtning-Sermon, and a Funeral-Sermon, and a Sermon at a Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a Sermon at the Canonization of himſelf that makes it. This Thief, whoſe words they are, is Baptized in his blood; there's his Chriſtning: He dyes in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; there's his Funeral: His Dioceſs is his Croſs, and he takes care of his ſoul, who is crucified with him, and to him he is a Biſhop; there's his Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration: and he is tranſlated to heaven; there's his Canonization. We have ſometimes mention in <hi>Moſes</hi> his book of <hi>Exodus,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Romane</hi> Tranſlation, <hi>Operis Plumarii,</hi> of a kind of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and various workmanſhip, imployed upon the Tabernacle, for which it is hard to finde a proper word now; we tranſlate it ſometimes Embroidery, ſometimes Needle-work, ſometimes otherwiſe. It is evident enough, that it was <hi>Opus variegatum,</hi> a work compact of divers pieces, curiouſly inlaid, and varied for
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93368:8"/>
the making up of ſome figure, ſome repreſentation: and likelyeſt to be that which in ſumptuous buildings, we uſe to call now <hi>Moſaick</hi> work: for that very word originally ſignifies, to vary, to mingle, to diverſifie. As the Tabernacle of God was, ſo the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures of God are of this <hi>Moſaick</hi> work: The body of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures hath in it limbs taken from other bodies; and in the word of God, are the words of other men, other authors, inlaid &amp; inſerted. But, this work is onely where the Holy Ghoſt is the Workman: It is not for man to inſert, to inlay other words into the word of God. It is a groſs piece of <hi>Moſaick</hi> work, to inſert whole Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal books into the Scriptures. It is a ſacrilegious defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of this <hi>Moſaick</hi> work, to take out of <hi>Moſes</hi> Tables, ſuch a ſtone as the ſecond Commandment; and to take out of the Lords Prayer, ſuch a ſtone as is the foundation-ſtone, the reaſon of the prayer, <hi>Quia Tuum, For thine is the kingdom,</hi> &amp;c. It is a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit piece of <hi>Moſaick</hi> work, when having made up a body of their Canon-Law, of the raggs and fragments torne from the body of the Fathers, they attribute to every particular ſentence in that book, not that authority which that ſentence had in that Father from whom it is taken, but that authority which the Canonization (as they call it) of that ſentence gives it; by which Canonization, and placing it in that book, it is made equal to the word of God.<note place="margin">Theſaurus Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicus.</note> It is a ſtrange piece of <hi>Moſaick</hi> work, when one of their greateſt authors pretending to preſent a body of proofs, for all controverted points, from the Scriptures, and Councels, and Fathers (for, he makes no mention in his promiſe of the Mothers of the Church) doth yet fill up that body with ſentences from women, and obtrude to us the Revelations of <hi>Brigid,</hi> and of <hi>Katherine,</hi> and ſuch She-fathers as thoſe. But when the Holy Ghoſt is the workman, in the true Scriptures, we have a glorious ſight of this <hi>Moſaick,</hi> this various, this mingled work; where the words of the Serpent in ſeducing our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, The words of <hi>Balaams</hi> Aſs in inſtructing the rider himſelf, The words of prophane Poets, in the writings and uſe of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, The words of <hi>Caiaphas</hi> propheſying that it was expedient that one ſhould dye for all, The words of the Divel himſelf <hi>(Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus I know, and Paul I know)</hi> And here in this text, the words of a Thief executed for the breach of the Law; do all concur to the making up of the Scriptures, of the word of God.</p>
            <p>Now, though theſe words were not ſpoken at this time, when we do but begin to celebrate by a poor and weak imitation, the faſting of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, but were ſpoken at the day of the crucifying of the Lord of life and glory; yet as I would be loath to think, that you never faſt but in Lent, ſo I would be loath to think that you never fulfill the ſufferings of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus in your fleſh, but upon Goodfriday, never meditate upon the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93368:8"/>
paſſion, but upon that day. As the Church celebrates an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, a preparation to the Incarnation of Chriſt, to his coming in the fleſh, in humiliation: ſo may this humiliation of ours in the text, be an Advent, a preparation to his Reſurrection, and coming in glory: And, as the whole life of Chriſt was a paſſion, ſo ſhould the whole life (eſpecially the humiliation) of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, be a continual meditation upon that. Chriſt began with ſome drops of blood in his infancy, in his Circumciſion; though he drowned the ſins of all mankinde, in thoſe ſeveral channels of Blood, which the whips, and nailes, and ſpear, cut out of his body in the day of his paſſion. So though the effects of his paſſion be to be preſented more fully to you, at the day of his paſſion, yet it is not unſeaſonable now, to contemplate thus far the working of it upon this condemned wretch, whoſe words this text is,<note place="margin">Diviſion.</note> as to conſider in them, Firſt, the infallibility, and the diſpatch of the grace of God upon them, whom his gracious purpoſe hath ordained to ſalvation: how powerfully he works; how inſtantly they obey. This condemned perſon who had been a thief, exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable amongſt men, and a blaſphemer, execrating God, was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly a Convertite, ſuddainly a Confeſſor, ſuddainly a Martyr, ſuddainly a Doctor to preach to others. In a ſecond conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we ſhall ſee what doctrine he preaches; not curioſities, not unrevealed Myſteries, not Matter of State, nor of wit, nor of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal delight, but onely the fear of God: <hi>Nonne times Deum?</hi> And for a third part, we ſhall ſee his Auditory, the Church that he preached to: he contented himſelf with a ſmall Pariſh; he had moſt care of their ſouls, that needed him moſt: he applies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the converſion of his fellow-Thief. He works upon thoſe ſins which he knew to have been in himſelf. And he works upon him by all theſe ſteps: Firſt, <hi>Nonne Tu?</hi> howſoever the reſt do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile Chriſt, becauſe they ſtay behinde, and look for a temporal <hi>Meſsias,</hi> to make this life ſweet, and glorious unto them; yet what's that to thee? thou art to have no part in it; howſoever they be, art not thou affected? <hi>Nonne Tu times?</hi> If the bitterneſs of thy torment cannot let thee love, though thy ſtomach will not come down to kiſs the rod and embrace correction, yet <hi>Nonne Tu times?</hi> Doth it not imprint a fear in thee? <hi>Nonne times Deum?</hi> Though the Law have done the worſt upon thee, Witneſſes, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates, Judges, Executioners can put thee in no more fear; yet, <hi>Nonne times Deum?</hi> Feareſt not thou God? who hath another Tribunal, another execution for thee; eſpecially when thou knoweſt thy condemnation, and ſuch a condemnation; <hi>Eandem,</hi> the ſame condemnation; And that this condemnation is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent, but now upon thee: when thou art now under the ſame condemnation, feareſt thou not God?</p>
            <p>The firſt thing then is, the powerfulneſs and the diſpatch of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93368:9"/>
the grace of God in the converſion of them, who are ordained unto it. In <hi>Judas,</hi> the Devil entred into him when Chriſt gave him the Sop;<note place="margin">Part. I. <hi>Gratia.</hi>
               </note> but the Devil had put the treaſon in his heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The tentation had an Inchoation, and it had a Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and it had a Conſummation. In Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, God wrought upon him all at once, without any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance; He took him at as much diſadvantage for grace to work, upon as could be; breathing threatnings and ſlaughters againſt the diſciples, and provided with Commiſſions for that perſecution. But ſuddainly there came a light, and ſuddainly a ſtroke that humbled him, and ſuddainly a voice, and ſuddainly a hand that led him to <hi>Damaſcus.</hi> After God had laid hold upon him, he never gave him over, till he had accompliſhed his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in him.</p>
            <p>Whether this grace, which God preſents ſo, be reſiſtible or no, whether man be not perverſe enough to reſiſt this grace, why ſhould any perverſe or ungracious man diſpute? Hath any man felt a tentation ſo ſtrong upon himſelf, but that he could have given another man reaſon enough to have kept him from yeilding to that tentation? Hath any man felt the grace of God work ſo upon him at any time, as that he hath concurred fully, intirely with that grace, without any reſiſtance, any ſlackneſs? Now faſhions in men, make us doubt new manners; and new terms in Divinity were ever ſuſpicious in the Church of God, that new Doctrines were hid under them. <hi>Reſistibility,</hi> and <hi>Irreſiſtibility</hi> of grace, which is every Artificers wearing now, was a ſtuff that our Fathers wore not, a language that pure antiquity ſpake not. They knew Gods ordinary proceeding. They knew his Common Law, and they knew his Chancery. They knew his chief Juſtice <hi>Moſes,</hi> that denounced his Judgements upon tranſgreſſors of the Law; and they knew his Chancellor Chriſt Jeſus, into whoſe hands he had put all Judgements, to mitigate the rigor and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the Law. They knew Gods law, and his Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: But for Gods prerogative, what he could do of his abſolute power, they knew Gods pleaſure, <hi>Nolumus diſputari:</hi> It ſhould ſcarce be diſputed of in Schools, much leſs ſerv'd in every popular pulpit to curious and itching ears; leaſt of all made table-talke, and houſhold-diſcourſe. Chriſt promiſes to come to the door, and to knock at the door, and to ſtand at the door, and to enter if any man open;<note place="margin">Revel. 3.</note> but he does not ſay, he will break open the door: it was not his pleaſure to expreſs ſuch an earneſtneſs, ſuch an Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtibility in his grace, ſo. Let us cheerfully rely upon that; His purpoſe ſhall not be fruſtrated; his ends ſhall not be prevented; his ways ſhall not be precluded: But the depth of the goodneſs of God, how much good God can do for man; yea the depth of the illneſs of man, how much ill man can do againſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93368:9"/>
God, are ſuch ſeas, as, if it be not impoſſible, at leaſt it is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, to go about to ſound them.</p>
            <p>Now, what God hath done,<note place="margin">Fac.</note> and will do for the moſt haynous offenders, we conſider in this man: Firſt, as he was execrable to men, a Thief; and then, as he execrated God, a Blaſphemer. Now this Thief is ordinarily taken, and ſo, in all probability, likely to have been a bloody thiefe, a Murderer: for, for theft onely, their laws did not provide ſo ſevere an execution as hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Croſs. We finde that <hi>Judas,</hi> who was a thief, made it a law upon himſelf, by executing himſelf, to hang a thief; but it was not the ordinary juſtice of that countrey. Firſt, then, he had been an enemy to the well-being of mankinde, by injuring the poſſeſſion, and the propriety, which men have juſtly in their goods, as he was a thief; and he had been an enemy to the very being of mankinde, if he were a Murderer.</p>
            <p>And certainly, the ſin of theft alone would be an execrable, a deteſtable ſin to us all, but that it is true of us all, <hi>Si videbas furem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 50.</note> 
               <hi>currebas cum eo:</hi> we ſee that all men are theeves in their kindes, in their courſes; but yet we know, that we our ſelves are ſo too. We may have heard of Princes that have put down Stewes, and executed ſevere Lawes againſt Licentiouſneſs; but that may have been to bring all the Licentiouſneſs of the City into the Court. We may have heard Sermons againſt Uſury; and this may have been, that they themſelves might put out their money the better. We may cry out againſt Theft, that we may ſteale the ſafelier. For we ſteale our preferment, if we bring no labour, nor learning to the Service; and we ſteale our Learning, if we forſake the Fountaines, and the Fathers, and the Schooles, and deale upon Rhapſoders, and Common placers, and Method-mongers. Let him that is without ſin, caſt the firſt ſtone; let him that hath ſtolne nothing, apprehend the thief: rather, let him that hath done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſteale, apprehend the thief, and preſent himſelf there, where this thief found mercy, at the Croſſe of Chriſt. Every man hath a ſop in his mouth; his own robberies will not let him complain of the theft of exceſſive Fees in all profeſſions; of the theft of preventing other mens merit with their money; (which is a robbing of others, and themſelves too;) of the theft of ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Affections, by unchaſte ſollicitations; or of the great theft of ſtealing of Hearts from Princes, and Souls from God, by inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Treaſon, and Superſtition, in a corrupt Religion in every corner. No man dares complain of others thefts, becauſe every man is <hi>felo de ſe;</hi> not onely that himſelf hath ſtolne, but that he hath ſtolne away himſelf. Yea, he is <hi>Homicida ſui,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tertul.</note> a Murderer of himſelf. <hi>Omnis peccator homicida,</hi> Every ſinner is a Murderer. <hi>Quaeris quem Occiderit?</hi> doth he plead Not guilty, or doth he put me to prove whom he hath murdered? <hi>Si quid ad Elogii ambitionem
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93368:10"/>
faciat, non inimicum, non extraneum, ſed ſeipſum.</hi> It he think it an honor to him, let him know, it is not an enemy, it is not a ſtranger, that he hath murdered, but himſelf, and his own ſoul. And ſuch a Thief, ſuch a Murderer was this; but not onely ſuch, but a publick Malefactor too; and ſo execrable to men: which is his firſt Indiſpoſition.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Blaſpemy.</note>He had alſo execrated God; he had reviled Chriſt. This E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt Saint <hi>Luke</hi> does not ſay ſo, that both the Theeves revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Chriſt: but that acquits not this thiefe, that Saint <hi>Luke</hi> does not ſay't, no more then it acquits them both, that S. <hi>John</hi> does not ſay, that either of them reviled Chriſt. And then both the other Evangeliſts, Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> and Saint <hi>Mark,</hi> charge them both with it.<note place="margin">Mat. 27.4.3. Mar. 15.32.</note> 
               <hi>The ſame</hi> (that is, thoſe reviling words which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had uſed) <hi>the theeves that were crucified caſt in his teeth.</hi> And, <hi>they alſo that were crucified with him, reviled him. Athanaſius</hi> in his Sermon <hi>Contra omnes haereſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Athanaſius.</note> makes no doubt of it: <hi>Duo Latrones; altero execrante, altero dicente, quid execramur?</hi> One Thief ſaid to the other, Why doe we revile Chriſt?<note place="margin">Origen.</note> ſo that <hi>de facto,</hi> he imputes it to them both; both did it. <hi>Origen</hi> ſayes, <hi>Conveniens eſt, inprimis ambos blaſphemaſſe;</hi> not onely that that is the moſt convenient Expoſition, but that it was the moſt convenient way to God, for expreſſing Mercy, and Juſtice too, that both ſhould have reviled him. <hi>Origen</hi> admits a conveniency in it.<note place="margin">Chryſoſtome.</note> 
               <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> implyes a neceſſity, <hi>Ne quis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſito rem factam putaret:</hi> leſt the world ſhould think it a plot, and that this Thief had been well diſpoſed and affected towards Chriſt before, therefore, ſayes he, firſt he declares himſelf to be his enemy, in reviling him, and then was ſuddainly reconciled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.<note place="margin">Hilarius.</note> 
               <hi>Hilary</hi> raiſes and builds a great point of Divinity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; that ſince both the Theeves, of which one was elect to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, did upbraid Chriſt with the ignominy of the Croſſe, <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſis etiam fidelibus ſcandalum Crucis futurum oſtendit:</hi> This ſhews, ſayes he, that even the faithfull and elect ſervants of God, may be ſhak'd, and ſcandalized, and fall away for a time, in the time of perſecution. He raiſes poſitive and literall Doctrine. And <hi>Theophylact</hi> raiſes myſtical and figurative Doctrine out of it;<note place="margin">Theophylact.</note> 
               <hi>Duo latrones figura Gentilium &amp; Judaeorum:</hi> both Jewes and Gentiles did reproach Chriſt, <hi>Sicut &amp; primo ambo latrones improperabant,</hi> as at firſt both the Theeves that were crucified did.<note place="margin">Hierom.</note> S. <hi>Hierome</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines to admit a figure in S. <hi>Matthews</hi> words: and he ſaith, that S. <hi>Matthew</hi> imputes that to both, which was ſpoken by one: But S. <hi>Hierom</hi> had no uſe of a figure here; for himſelfe ſayes, that <hi>Matthew,</hi> which imputes this to both; and <hi>Luke,</hi> which imputes it to one, differ not: for, ſaith he, both reviled Chriſt at firſt; and then, one, <hi>Viſis miraculis credidit,</hi> upon the evidence of Chriſts Miracles, changed his mind, and believed in him. Onely S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:93368:10"/>
is confident in it, that this Thief never reviled Chriſt; but thinks, that that phraſe of <hi>Matthew,</hi> and of <hi>Mark,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> who impute it to both, is no more, but as if one ſhould ſay, <hi>Ruſticani inſultant;</hi> mean men, baſe men, do triumph over me: which, ſays he, might be ſaid, if any one ſuch perſon did ſo. Now, this might be true, if it had been ſaid, Theeves and Malefactors reviled Chriſt: But, when it is expreſly ſaid, The Theeves that were crucified, I take it to be a way of deriving the greater comfort upon us, and the greater glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry upon Chriſt, and the greater aſſurance upon the Priſoner, to leave him to the mercy of God, rather then to the wit of Man; and rather to ſuffer Chriſt Jeſus to pardon him, being guilty, then to diſpute for his innocence. For, perchance, we ſhall lack an example of a notorious Blaſphemer, and reviler of Chriſt, to be effectually converted to ſalvation (of which example, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how our times abound and overflow with this ſin, we ſtand much in need) except this thief be our example; that though he were execrable to men, and execrated God, yet Chriſt Jeſus took him into thoſe bowels which he had ripp'd up, and into thoſe wounds which he had opened wider by his execrations, and had mercy upon him, and buried him in them. And this was his ſecond Indiſpoſition.</p>
            <p>Now, for the ſpeed and powerfull working of this Grace,<note place="margin">Impetus.</note> to his Converſion; we muſt not inſiſt long upon it, leſt we be longer in expreſſing it, then it was in doing. We have no impreſſion, no direction of the time, when his converſion was wrought. None of the Evangeliſts mention when nor how it was done: None, but this Evangeliſt, that it was done at all. But he mentions it in the cleareſt and ſafeſt demonſtration of all; that is, in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his converſion, his deſire to convert others. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may diſcerne, <hi>Impetum Gratiae, in impetu poenitentis:</hi> the force, the vehemence of Gods grace, in the vehemence of his zeale. Chriſt himſelf was ſilent, when this thief reviled him: and yet this thief comes preſently to a zealous impatience, he cannot hear his companion revile. Chriſt had eſtated his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in heaven; he had given them Reverſions of Judiciary pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in heaven, twelve Seats, to judge the twelve Tribes: and yet <hi>Facit fides innocentes Latrones, facit perfidia Apoſtolos criminoſos:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ambr.</note> he infuſes ſo much faith into this thief, as juſtifies him; and leaves his Apoſtles ſo far to their infirmity, as endangers them. To the chief of theſe Apoſtles (in ſome ſervices) to <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf,<note place="margin">Jo. 13.36.</note> he ſayes, <hi>Whither I go, thou canſt not follow me now;</hi> and to this thief he ſayes, <hi>Hodie mecum eris, This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi> So ſoon did he bring this thief, <hi>Cui damnari ad tempus expedivit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ambroſ.</note> that had a good bargain of death, that ſcap'd by being condemned, and was the better, and longer liv'd for being hang'd; (for he was thereby, <hi>Collega Martyrii,</hi> and <hi>particeps Regni,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cyprian.</note> partaker of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93368:11"/>
Chriſts Martyrdome, and partner of his Kingdome; he brought him ſo ſoon to that height of faith, that even in that low ſtate upon the Croſs, he prayed for a ſpiritual Kingdom: whereas the Apoſtles themſelves, in that exaltation, when Chriſt was aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, talk'd to him of a temporall Kingdome. He came to know thoſe Wounds which were in Chriſts Body,<note place="margin">Ambr.</note> 
               <hi>Non eſſe Chriſti, ſed Latronis, &amp; amare caepit;</hi> then he began to love him perfectly, when he found his own wounds in the body of his Saviour. So he came to declare perfect faith,<note place="margin">Gregory.</note> in profeſſing Chriſts innocence, <hi>This man hath done nothing;</hi> and perfect Hope, in the <hi>Momento Mei, Remember me in thy Kingdome;</hi> and perfect Charity, in this incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation and rebuking of his companion.<note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> He was, as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayes, <hi>Latro Laudabilis &amp; miraculis;</hi> ſuch a thief as deſerved praiſe, and afforded wonder: but the beſt is the laſt, that he was <hi>imitabilis;</hi> that he hath done nothing, but that we may do ſo too,<note place="margin">Idem.</note> if we will apprehend that grace that he did. <hi>Aſſumamus vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem Latronis, ſi non volumus eſſe Latrones:</hi> If we will not ſteal our ſelves out of the number,<note place="margin">Idem</note> to whom God offers his ſaving grace. <hi>Ut ſedeamus a dextris, pendeamus a dextris;</hi> let us be content to ſuffer, but to ſuffer in the right. Suffering as Malefactors, is ſomewhat too much on the left hand; though even that ſuffering do bring many to the right hand too. But ſuffering for Schiſme in pretence of Zeal, ſuffering for Treaſon in pretence of Religion; this is both to turn out of this world on the left hand, and to remain on that hand for ever after in the world to come. This thief hung on the right hand, and was ſuddenly made a Confeſſor for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, a Martyr to witneſſe for Chriſt, a Doctor to preach to his fellow. If the favour of a Prince can make a man a Doctor, <hi>per ſaltum,</hi> much more the mercy of Chriſt Jeſus, which gives the Sufficiency as well as the Title: as he did in this Thief, this new Doctor, whoſe Doctrine it ſelf is our next conſideration.</p>

               <note place="margin">Part. II. <hi>Doctrina.</hi>
               </note>This doctrine was the fear of God, which was a pregnant and a plentiful common place for him to preach upon. And upon ſuch an occaſion, and ſuch abundance of matter, we have here one example of an extemporal Sermon; This Thief had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated nothing. But he is no more a precedent for extempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral preaching, then he is for ſtealing. He was a Thief before, and he was an extemporal preacher at laſt: But he teaches no body elſe to be either. It is true, that if we conſider the Sermons of the Ancient Fathers, we ſhall finde ſome impreſſions, ſome examples of ſuddain and unpremeditated Sermons. Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> ſome times eaſes himſelf upon ſo long Texts,<note place="margin">Ser. <hi>10</hi> de ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis Hpli.</note> as needed no great preparation, no great ſtudy; for a meer paraphraſe upon this Text, was enough for all his hour, when he took both Epiſtle and Goſpel,<note place="margin">Ser. de Sancto Latrone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> and Pſalm of the day for his Text. We may ſee often in <hi>S. Bern. (Heri diximus,</hi> and <hi>Heſterno die fecimus mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem)</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:93368:11"/>
that he preached divers days together. In the ſecond of thoſe Sermons of Saint <hi>Baſil,</hi> which were upon the beginning of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> it ſeems that <hi>Baſil</hi> preached twice in a day; and in his Sermon <hi>de Baptiſmo,</hi> it ſeemes that he truſted upon the Holy Ghoſt, and his preſent inſpiration: <hi>Loquemar prout Sermo nobis da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitur in apertione oris:</hi> I intend to ſpeak ſo, as the Holy Ghoſt ſhall give me utterance for the preſent. But as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſays in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother caſe, <hi>Da mihi Paulum;</hi> ſo <hi>Da mihi Baſilios,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtinos;</hi> bring ſuch preachers as <hi>Baſil</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> were, and let them preach as often as they will; and let every man whoſe calling it is, preach as often as he can; but let him not think that he can preach as often as he can ſpeak. An inordinate opinion of purity, brought ſome men to keep two Sabbaths a week, and others two Lents every year; and an opinion of a neceſſity of two Sermons every Sabbath, and two hours every Sermon, may bring them to an opinion, that the ſanctifying of the Sabbath conſiſts in the patience of hearing.</p>
            <p>Here was an extemporal Sermon, but a ſhort one: he preaches nothing but the fear of God. It is not <hi>De arcanis Imperii,</hi> matter of State: nor <hi>De arcanis Dei,</hi> of the unrevealed decrees of God. The Thief does not ſay to Chriſt, <hi>Perage quod decreveris;</hi> Thou haſt decreed my converſion, and therefore that decree muſt be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that muſt neceſſarily be performed, which thou hadſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in thy Kingdom before thou cameſt from thence; but he ſays, <hi>Memento mei, cum veneris;</hi> Take ſuch a care of me, for my ſalvation, and preſervation, and perſeverance, as that I may follow thee into that Kingdom, into which thou art now going; for our ſalvation is opened to us in that way, which Chriſt hath opened by his death: and without him, we underſtand no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of election; without his ſecond going into his Kingdome, we know nothing of that which he did, before he came from thence. This is then the fear of God,<note place="margin">Pſal. 11.10. Prov. 1.7.</note> which thoſe royall Doctors of the old Teſtament, <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> both preached, and which this Primitive Doctor of the Primitive Church, this new Convertite preached too, That no man may be ſo ſecure in his election, as to forbear to work out his ſalvation with fear and trembling: for God ſaves no man againſt his will, nor any man that thinks himſelf beholding for nothing, after the firſt decree.<note place="margin">Dan. 11.38.</note> There is a name of force, of violence, of neceſſity attributed to a God, which is <hi>Mauzzim:</hi> but it is the name of an Idol, not of a true God. The name of the true God is <hi>Dominus tzebaoth,</hi> the <hi>Lord of Hoſts;</hi> a name of power, but not of force. There is a fear belongs to him; his purpoſes ſhall certainly be executed, but regularly and orderly; he will be feared, not becauſe he forces us, imprints a neceſſity, a coaction upon us; but becauſe, if we be not led by his orderly proceeding, there he hath power to caſt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93368:12"/>
body and ſoul into hell fire; therefore he will be feared, not as a wilfull Tyrant, but as a juſt Judge; not as <hi>Mauzzim,</hi> the god of Violence, but as <hi>Dominus tzebaoth,</hi> the Lord of Hoſts.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Part 3.</note>This then is his Doctrine; and what's his Auditory? He is not reſerved for Courts, nor for populous Cities; it is but a poor Pariſh that he hath; and yet he thinks of no change, but means to dye there: and there he viſits the pooreſt, the ſickeſt, the wretchedeſt perſon, the Thief. He had ſeen divers other of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſorts,<note place="margin">Mat. 27.38.</note> revile Chriſt as deeply as this Thief: <hi>They that paſſed by reviled him: Praetereuntes,</hi> they that did not ſo much as conſider him, reviled him. They that know not Chriſt, yet will blaſpheme him: if we ask them when, and where, and how, and why Chriſt Jeſus was born, and lived, and dyed, they cannot tell it in their Creed; and yet they can tell it in their Oathes: they know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his Miraculous Life, of his Humble Death, of his Bitter Paſſion, of the Ranſome of his Blood, of the Sanctuary of his Wounds; and yet his Life, and Death, and Paſſion, and Blood, and Wounds, is oftner in their mouthes in execrations, then in the mouth of the moſt religious man in his prayers. They revile Chriſt <hi>Praetereuntes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Origen.</note> as they paſs along: not onely as <hi>Origen</hi> ſayes here, <hi>Non incedentes recte, blaſphemant,</hi> they did not go perverſly, crookedly,<note place="margin">Hierom.</note> wilfully, and ſo blaſpheme: nor as <hi>Hierome, Non am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulantes in vero itinere Scripturarum, blaſphemant;</hi> they did not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpret places of Scripture, to maintaine their errours, and ſo blaſpheme; but they blaſphemed <hi>Praetereuntes,</hi> out of neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent cuſtome and habit; they blaſpheme Chriſt, and never think of it; that they may be damned <hi>obiter,</hi> by the way, collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, occaſionately damned.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Luke 23.24.</note>But it was not onely they, <hi>Praetereuntes,</hi> but the people that ſtood, and beheld, reviled Chriſt too: men that doe underſtand Chriſt, even then when they diſhonour him, doe diſhonour him to accompany ſome greater perſons upon whom they depend, in their errours. The Prieſts, who ſhould have called the Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,<note place="margin">Thr. 1.12.</note> with that, <hi>Have ye no regard, all ye that paſſe by the way?</hi> the Scribes, who ſhould have applyed the ancient Propheſies to the preſent accompliſhment of them in the death of Chriſt: the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, who ſhould have ſupplied their imperfect fulfilling of the Law, in that full ſatisfaction, the death of Chriſt: the Elders, the Rulers, the Souldiers, are all noted to have reviled Chriſt: they all concurre to the performance of that Propheſie in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt; and yet they will not ſee that the Propheſie is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in him:<note place="margin">Pſal. 22.7. Pſal. 69.26.</note> 
               <hi>All they that ſee me have me in deriſion: they perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute him whom thou haſt ſmitten, and they adde unto the ſorrowes of him whom thou hast wounded: Our Fathers truſted in thee, they truſted in thee,</hi>

               <hi>and were delivered; but I am a worm and no man, a ſhame to men,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93368:12"/>
and the contempt of the people. Pilate</hi> had loſt his plot upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to mollifie them towards Chriſt; he brought him out to them, <hi>Flagellatum &amp; illuſum,</hi> ſcourged and ſcorned,<note place="margin">John 19.1.</note> thinking that that would have reduced them. But this Preacher leaves all the reſt, either to their farther obduration, or their fitter time of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, if God had ordained any ſuch time for them: &amp; he turns to this one, whoſe diſpoſition he knew to have been like his own, and therefore hoped his converſion would be ſo too; for nothing gives the faithfull ſervants of God a greater encouragement that their labors ſhall proſper upon others, then a conſideration of their own caſe, &amp; an acknowledgement what God hath done for their ſouls. When the fear of God had wrought upon himſelf, then he comes to his fellow, <hi>Nonne tu times?</hi> feareſt not thou? Firſt,<note place="margin">Times.</note> 
               <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne tu?</hi> We have not that advantage over our auditory, which he had over his, to know that in every particular man, there is ſome reaſon why he ſhould be more afraid of Gods judgements then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother man. But every particular man, who is acquainted with his own hiſtory, may be ſuch a Preacher to himſelf, and ask him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>Nonne tu,</hi> haſt not thou more reaſon to ſtand in fear of God then any other man, for any thing that thou knoweſt? Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou any man ſo deeply indebted to God, ſo far behind-hand with God, ſo much in danger of his executions as thou art? Thou knoweſt not his colluctations before he fell, nor his Repentances ſince: when thou heareſt S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <hi>Quorum maximus,</hi> hadſt not thou need ſay, <hi>Nonne tu?</hi> Doſt not thou fear, who knoweſt more by thy ſelf, then S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Hiſtory hath told thee of S. <hi>Paul?</hi> for in all his Hiſtory thou never ſeeſt any thing done by him againſt his conſcience: and is thy caſe as good as that? But to this thief, this thief preſſes this no farther, but this, what hope ſoever of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happineſs in this life, by the coming of a <hi>Meſsias,</hi> thoſe that ſtay in the world can expect, what's all that to thee, who art go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the world? <hi>Quid mihi,</hi> ſayes that man, who looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Rainbow when he was ready to drown; though God have promiſed not to drown the world, what's that to me, if I muſt drown? I muſt be bold to ſay to thee, <hi>Quid tibi?</hi> if God by his omnipotent power will uphold his Goſpel in the world, he owes thee no thanks, if thou do nothing in thy calling towards the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of it. <hi>Nonne tu?</hi> Doſt not thou feare, that though that ſtand, Gods judgement will fall upon thee for having put no hand to the ſtaying of it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nonne tu times?</hi> It had been unreaſonable to have ſpoken to him of the love of God firſt now, when thoſe heavy judgements were upon him. The Fear of God is alwayes the beginning of Wiſdome; moſt of all in calamity, which is properly <hi>Vehiculum timoris,</hi> the Chariot to convey, and the Seal to imprint this feare in us. <hi>Becauſe I thought, ſurely the feare of God is not in this place;</hi>

               <hi>therefore I ſaid Sarah was my ſiſter.</hi> Where there is not the fear of God in great perſons, other men dare not proceed clearly with them, but with diſguiſes and Modifications: they dare not attribute their proſperity, and good ſucceſs to the goodneſs of God, but muſt attribute it to their wiſdome: they dare not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute their croſſes and ill ſucceſſe to the juſtice of God, but muſt attribute it to the weakneſs or falſhood of ſervants and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters: where there is not this fear of God, there is no direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Beloved, there is love enough at all hands; it is a loving age every where, love enough in every corner, ſuch as it is; but ſcarce any feare amongſt us. Great men are above fear, no envy can reach them: Miſerable men are below fear, no change can make them worſe: and for perſons of middle rank, and more publick feares, of plagues, of famines, or ſuch, the abundant and over-flowing goodneſs of God hath ſo long accuſtomed us to miraculous deliverances, that we feare nothing, but thinke to have miracles in ordinary, and neglect ordinary remedies.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Deum.</note>But what ſhould this man fear now? his Glaſs was run out, his Bell was rung out, he was a dead man, condemned, and jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and executed; what ſhould he fear? In <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Veſtal Virgins which dyed, were buried within the city, becauſe they dyed innocent: ſo perſons which were executed by Juſtice, were buryed there too, becauſe they had ſatisfied the Law, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſeemed to be reſtored to their innocence. So that condemned perſons might ſeem leaſt of all to feare. But yet, <hi>Nonne ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes Deum?</hi> feareſt not thou God, for all that? Have not the laws of Men, Witneſſes, Judges, and Executioners, all men, brought fearfull things upon thee already? and is it not a fearfull thing, if all thoſe real torments, be but Types and Figures of thoſe grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which God will inflict upon thee after death? How eaſily hath a cunning malefactor ſometimes deluded and circumvented a mild Juſtice at home, that lives neighbourly by him, and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt glad to be deceived in favour of life! but how would this man be confounded, if he came to be examined at the Council-table, or by the King? <hi>Omni ſeverius quaeſtione a te interrogari,</hi> was ſaid by one of the Panegyricks to one of the Roman Emperours, That it was worſe then the rack, to be examined by him. When we come to ſtand naked before God, without that apparel which he made for us, without all righteouſneſs, and without that appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell which we made for our ſelves; not a fig-leaf, not an excuſe to cover us; if we think to deale upon his affections, he hath none; if we think to hide our ſins, he was with us when we did them, and ſaw them: we ſhall ſee then by his examination, that he knowes them better then we our ſelves.</p>

               </note>And to this purpoſe, to ſhew Gods particular judgement upon all men, and all actions then, it is, that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (if that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93368:13"/>
Sermon which is the 130. <hi>de Tempore,</hi> be his, for it is in the copies of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> too) reads thoſe words thus: <hi>Nonne times Deum tuum?</hi> feareſt not thou thy God? that if a man would go about to wrap up all in Gods generall providence (all muſt be as God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it) he might be brought to this particular conſideration, that he is <hi>Deus tuus;</hi> not onely God of the world, and God of mankinde, but thy God: ſo far thine, as he ſhall be thy Judge: In all ſenſes, and to all intendments, that may make him the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier to thee, he is thy God: he ſhall be thy God in his ſevere exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, as he is <hi>Scrutator Renum,</hi> as he ſearches thy reines: thy God, in putting off all reſpect of perſons, in renouncing kindred, <hi>Mater &amp; frater;</hi> they are of kin to him, that do his will: and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing acquaintance at the laſt day, <hi>Neſcio vos,</hi> I know not whence you are: and thy God in pronouncing judgement then, <hi>Ite maledicti,</hi> go ye accurſed. He ſhall be ſtill <hi>Deus tuus,</hi> thy God, till it come to <hi>Jeſus tuus,</hi> till it come to the point of redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſalvation; he ſhall be thy God, but not thy Redeemer, thy Saviour. And therefore it is well urged in this place by Saint <hi>Auguſtine, Nonne times Deum tuum? Feareſt not thou thy God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eſpecially this great calamity being actually upon thee now.<note place="margin">Condemnatio.</note> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> when he would have converted <hi>Agrippa</hi> and all the company, he wiſhes they were all like him, in all things,<note place="margin">Act. 26.29.</note> 
               <hi>Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis vinculis,</hi> excepting his bands. This new convert deals upon his fellow with that argument, <hi>Quia in iiſdem vinculis;</hi> ſince thou art under the ſame condemnation, thou ſhouldeſt have the ſame affections. Now the general condemnation, which is upon all mankind, that they muſt dye, this alone ſcarce frights any man, ſcarce averts any man from his purpoſes. He that ſhould firſt put to Sea in a tempeſt, he might eaſily think, it were in the nature of the Sea to be rough always. He that ſees every Church-yard ſwell with the waves and billows of graves, can think it no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary thing to dye, when he knows he ſet out in a ſtorm, and he was born into the world upon that condition, to go out of it again. But when <hi>Nathan</hi> would work upon <hi>David,</hi> he puts him a particular caſe, appliable to himſelf; and when he had drawn from him an implicite condemnation of himſelf, then he applies it. When <hi>David</hi> had ſaid, <hi>As the Lord liveth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.</note> 
               <hi>the man that hath done this ſhall ſurely dye;</hi> and <hi>Nathan</hi> upon that had ſaid, <hi>Thou art the man:</hi> Then <hi>David</hi> came to his <hi>Peccavi coram Domino, I have ſinned againſt the Lord;</hi> and <hi>Nathan</hi> to his <hi>Transtulit Dominus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> The Lord hath taken away thy ſin. And ſo this preacher, <hi>Qui clavis confixus non habuit ſenſum confixum,</hi> who though he were crucified in body, had his ſpirit and his charity at liberty, he preſſes his fellow to this fear, therefore, becauſe he is under a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular condemnation; not becauſe he muſt dye, but becauſe he
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93368:14"/>
muſt dye thus: and every man may find ſome ſuch particular condemnation in himſelf, and in his own croſſes, if he will but read his own hiſtory in a true copy.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Eadem.</note>It is <hi>ſub eadem,</hi> the ſame condemnation. If this identity be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, in compariſon with Chriſts condemnation, the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon holds only in this: judgment is given upon you both, execution begun upon you both, both equally ignominious, equally miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in the eye of the world: why doeſt thou inſult upon him, revile him, who art in as ill ſtate as he? thou ſeeſt him, who (though thou knoweſt it not, hath other manner of aſſurances, then thou canſt have) in Agonies, in Feares, in Complaints, in Lamentations: Why feareſt not thou, being under the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation? If this <hi>eadem condemnatio</hi> be intended in compariſon of himſelf that ſpeaks, then the compariſon holds only thus, Thou haſt no better a life then I, thou art no farther from thy death then I; and the conſideration of my condemnation, hath brought me to fear God: why ſhouldſt not thou feare, being under the ſame condemnation? eſpecially there being no adjourning of the Court, no putting off the Sizes, no Reprieve for Execution: Thou art now under the ſame condemnation, the ſame Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: why ſhouldſt thou not fear now? why ſhouldſt thou not go ſo far towards thy converſion this minute?

Ye defile one anothers wife, and ye ſtand upon the ſword, and ſhall ye poſſeſs the land?</hi> We were but one, and are many; 'tis true: God hath teſtified his love, in multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying Inhabitants, and in uniting Kingdomes; but if there be a lifting up of eyes towards Idols, a declination towards an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Religion; if there be a defiling of one anothers wife, and then ſtanding upon the ſword, that it muſt be matter of diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or of quarrel, if one will not betray his wife, or ſiſter, to the luſt of the greateſt perſon; ſhall we poſſeſs the land? ſhall we have a continuance of Gods bleſſing upon us? we ſhall not. And as he thus repreſents their over-confident behaviour towards God; God is bound by his promiſe, and therefore we may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure: And their over-diffident behaviour; God hath begun to ſhew his anger upon us, &amp; therefore there is no recovery: he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends alſo that diſtemper, which ordinarily accompanies this behaviour towards God, that is, an Expoſtulation, and a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputing with God, and a cenſuring of his actions: in the 20 ver. they come to ſay, <hi>The way of the Lord is not equal;</hi> that is, we know not how to deal with him, we know not where to find him; he promiſes Mercies, and layes Afflictions upon us; he threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens judgements upon the wicked, and yet the wicked proſper
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93368:15"/>
moſt of all; <hi>The ways of the Lord are equal.</hi> But, to this alſo God ſays by the Prophet, <hi>I will judge every one of you after his own ways. The ways of the Lord are unſearchable;</hi> look ye to your own ways, for accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, ſhall God judge you. And then after theſe ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, this watchman raiſes himſelf to the higheſt pinacle of all, to diſcover the greateſt ſin of all, treaſon within doors, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning of God in his own houſe, and in his preſence; that is, a coming to Church to hear the word of God preached, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of cheerfulneſs and alacrity, in the outward ſervice of God, yea a true ſenſe and feeling of a delight in hearing of the word; and yet for all this, an unprofitable barrenneſs, and (upon the whole matter) a deſpiteful and a contumelious neglecting of Gods purpoſe and intention, in his Ordinance: for, Our voice is unto them but as a ſong to an inſtrument; they hear our words, but they do them not.</p>
            <p>Though then ſome Expoſitors take theſe words to be an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation upon the people, that they eſteemed Gods ableſt Miniſters, indued with the beſt parts, to be but as muſique, as a jeſt, as a ſong, as an entertainment; that they under-valued and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteemed the whole ſervice of God in the function of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, and thought it either nothing, or but matter of State and Government, as a civil ordinance for civil order, and no more: yet I take this increpation to reach to a ſin of another nature; that the people ſhould attribute reverence enough, attention enough, credit enough to the preacher, and to his preachings, but yet when all that is done, nothing is done: they ſhould hear wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, but they do nothing of that which they had heard.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, God for his own glory promiſes here,<note place="margin">Diviſio.</note> that his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, his Miniſter ſhall be <hi>Tuba,</hi> as is ſaid in the beginning of this Chapter, a Trumpet, to awaken with terror. But then, he ſhall become <hi>Carmen muſicum,</hi> a muſical and harmonious char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, to ſettle and compoſe the ſoul again in a repoſed confidence, and in a delight in God: he ſhall be <hi>muſicum carmen,</hi> muſick, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the ſoul in his matter; he ſhall preach harmonious peace to the conſcience: and he ſhall be <hi>muſicum carmen,</hi> muſick and harmony in his manner; he ſhall not preſent the meſſages of God rudely, barbarouſly, extemporally; but with ſuch medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and preparation as appertains to ſo great an imployment, from ſuch a King as God, to ſuch a State as his Church: ſo he ſhall be <hi>muſicum carmen,</hi> muſicke, harmony, <hi>in re &amp; modo,</hi> in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and in manner: And then <hi>muſicum</hi> ſo much farther (as the text adds) as that he ſhall have a pleaſant voice, that is, to preach firſt ſincerely (for a preaching to ſerve turns and humors, cannot, at leaſt ſhould not pleaſe any) but then it is to preach accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, ſeaſonably, with a ſpiritual delight, to a diſcreet and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied congregation, that by the way of ſuch a holy delight, they may receive the more profit. And then he ſhall play well on an
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93368:16"/>
inſtrument; which we do not take here to be the working upon the underſtanding and affections of the Auditory, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation ſhall be his inſtrument; but as S. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſays, <hi>Corpus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis, Organum Dei,</hi> when the perſon acts that which the ſong ſays; when the words become works, this is a ſong to an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for, as S. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> purſues the ſame purpoſe, <hi>Pſallere eſt ex preceptis Dei agere;</hi> to ſing, and to ſing to an inſtrument, is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that holy duty in action, which we ſpeak of in diſcourſe: And God ſhall ſend his people preachers furniſhed with all theſe abilities, to be <hi>Tubae,</hi> Trumpets to awaken them; and then to be <hi>carmen muſicum,</hi> to ſing Gods mercies in their ears, in reverent, but yet in a diligent, and thereby a delightful manner; and ſo to be muſick in their preaching, and muſick in their example, in a holy converſation: <hi>Eris,</hi> ſays God to this prophet, ſuch a one thou ſhalt be, thou ſhalt be ſuch a one in thy ſelf; and then <hi>eris illis,</hi> thou ſhalt be ſo to them, to the people: To them thou ſhalt be <hi>Tuba,</hi> a Trumpet, Thy preaching ſhall awaken them, and ſo bring them to ſome ſence of their ſins: To them thou ſhalt be <hi>carmen muſicum,</hi> muſick and harmony; both <hi>in re,</hi> in thy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they ſhall conceive an apprehenſion or an offer of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy through thee; and <hi>in modo,</hi> in the manner; they ſhall confeſs, that thy labors work upon them, and move them, and affect them, and that that unpremeditated, and drowſie, and cold manner of preaching, agrees not with the dignity of Gods ſervice: they ſhall acknowledge (ſays God to this Prophet) thy pleaſant voice; confeſſe thy doctrine to be good, and confeſſe thy playing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Inſtrument, acknowledge thy life to be good too; for, in teſtimony of all this, <hi>Audient</hi> (ſaies the text) They ſhall hear this. Now, every one that might come, does not ſo; buſineſſes, nay leſs then buſineſſes, vanities, keep many from hence; leſs then vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, nothing; many, that have nothing to do, yet are not here: All are not come that might come; nor are all that are here, come hither; penalty of law, obſervation of abſences, invitation of company, affection to a particular preacher, collateral reſpects, draw men; and they that are drawn ſo, do not come; neither do all that are come, hear; they ſleep, or they talk: but <hi>Audient,</hi> ſays our text, They ſhall be here, they ſhall come, they ſhall hear; they ſhall preſs to hear: every one that would come, if he might ſit at eaſe, will not be troubled for a Sermon: but our caſe is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Audient,</hi> they ſhall riſe earlier then their fellows, come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſooner, indure more pains, hearken more diligently, and conceive more delight then their fellows: <hi>Audient,</hi> they will hear: but then, after all (which is the height of the malediction, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepation, <hi>Non facient,</hi> they will not do it; <hi>Non facient quae dixeris,</hi> They will do nothing of that which thou haſt ſaid to them; nay, <hi>non facient quae dixerunt,</hi> they will do nothing of that, which du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of the Sermons, they had ſaid to their own ſouls,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93368:16"/>
they would do; ſo little hold ſhall Gods beſt means, and by his beſt inſtruments, take of them; <hi>They ſhall hear thy words, and ſhall not do them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe then are our parts that make up this increpation: Firſt, the Prophet ſhall do his part fully: Secondly, the people ſhall do ſome of theirs: But then laſtly, they ſhall fail in the principal, and ſo make all uneffectual. Firſt, God will ſend them Prophets that ſhall be <hi>Tubae,</hi> Trumpets; and not onely that, but <hi>ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores;</hi> not onely Trumpets which ſound according to the meaſure of breath that is blown into them, but they themſelves are the watchmen that are to ſound them: not Trumpets to ſound out what airs the occaſion of the preſent time, or what airs the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of great perſons infuſe into them; for ſo they are only Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, and not Trumpetors; but God hath made them both: And, as in civil matters, <hi>Anguſta innocentia eſt, ad legem bonum eſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Seneca.</note> That's but a narrow, but a faint honeſty, to be no honeſter then a man muſt needs be, no honeſter then the law, or then his bodily ſickneſs conſtrains him to be; ſo are theſe Trumpets ſhort-wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Trumpets, if they ſound no oftner then the Canons enjoyn them to ſound; for, they muſt preach in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon: If the Canonical ſeaſon be but once a month, the preaching be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween, is not ſo unſeaſonable, but that it is within the Apoſtles precept too. If that be done, if the watchman ſound the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, ſays the beginning of this Chapter (when you ſee it is the watchman himſelf that ſounds, and not another to ſound him; he is neither to be an inſtrument of others, nor is he to ſound al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways by others, and ſpare his own breath) but if the watchman do duly ſound, then there is an <hi>Euge bone ſerve,</hi> belongs to him; <hi>Well done good and faithful ſervant, enter into thy Maſters joy:</hi> And if he be not heard, or be not followed, then there is a <hi>vae Betſaida,</hi> a wo belonging to that City, and to that houſe; for, if thoſe works had been done in <hi>Sodom,</hi> if all this preaching had been at <hi>Rome, Rome</hi> would have repented in ſackcloth and aſhes.<note place="margin">Jer. 6.17.</note> I ſet watchmen over you, ſays God in another Prophet, <hi>Et dixi, Audite,</hi> I ſaid unto you, Hearken to them: ſo far God addreſſes himſelf to them, ſpeaks perſonally to them, <hi>ſuper vos,</hi> and <hi>Audite vos;</hi> I ſent to you, and hear you: but when they would not hear, then he changes the perſon, <hi>Et dixerunt,</hi> ſays that text, And they ſaid, We will not hear: after this ſtubbornneſs, God does not ſo much as ſpeak to them: it is not <hi>Dixiſtis,</hi> you ſaid it; God will have no more to do with them; but it is <hi>Dixerunt,</hi> they ſaid it; God ſpeaks of them as of ſtrangers. But this is not altogether the caſe in our text: God ſhall ſend Prophets, Trumpets, and Trumpetors, that is, preachers of his word, and not the word of men; and they ſhall be heard willingly too; for as they are <hi>Tubae,</hi> Trumpets, ſo they ſhall be <hi>muſicum carmen,</hi> acceptable muſick to them that hear them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:93368:17"/>They ſhall be ſo, firſt <hi>In re,</hi> in their matter, in the doctrine which they preach.<note place="margin">In Re.</note> The ſame trumpets that ſound the alarm (that is, that awakens us from our ſecurity) and that ſounds the Battail (that is, that puts us into a colluctation with our ſelves, with this world, with powers and principalities, yea into a wra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtling with God himſelf and his Juſtice) the ſame trumpet ſounds the Parle too, calls us to hearken to God in his word, and to ſpeak to God in our prayers, and ſo to come to treaties and capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulations for peace; and the ſame trumpet ſounds a retreat too, that is, a ſafe repoſing of our ſouls in the merit, and in the wounds of our Saviour Chriſt Jeſus. And in this voice they are <hi>muſicum carmen,</hi> a love-ſong (as the text ſpeaks) in propoſing the love of God to man, wherein he loved him ſo, as that he gave his onely begotten Son for him. God made this whole world in ſuch an uniformity, ſuch a correſpondency, ſuch a concinnity of parts, as that it was an Inſtrument, perfectly in tune: we may ſay, the trebles, the higheſt ſtrings were diſordered firſt; the beſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, Angels and Men, put this inſtrument out of tune. God rectified all again, by putting in a new ſtring, <hi>ſemen mulieris,</hi> the ſeed of the woman, the <hi>Meſsias:</hi> And onely by ſounding that ſtring in your ears, become we <hi>muſicum carmen,</hi> true muſick, true harmony, true peace to you. If we ſhall ſay, that Gods firſt ſtring in this inſtrument, was Reprobation, that Gods firſt inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was, for his glory to damn man; and that then he put in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſtring, of creating Man, that ſo he might have ſome body to damn; and then another of enforcing him to ſin, that ſo he might have a juſt cauſe to damne him; and then another, of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling him to lay hold upon any means of recovery: there's no muſick in all this, no harmony, no peace in ſuch preaching. But if we take this inſtrument, when Gods hand tun'd it the ſecond time, in the promiſe of a <hi>Meſsias,</hi> and offer of the love &amp; mercy of God to all that will receive it in him; then we are truely <hi>muſicum carmen,</hi> as a love-ſong, when we preſent the love of God to you, and raiſe you to the love of God in Chriſt Jeſus: for, for the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick of the Sphears, whatſoever it be, we cannot hear it; for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of God in heaven, we cannot ſay we have ſeen them; our muſick is onely that ſalvation which is declared in the Goſpel to all them, and to them onely, who take God by the right hand, as he delivers himſelf in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>So they ſhall be muſick <hi>in re,</hi> in their matter, in their doctrine; and they ſhall be alſo <hi>in modo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In modo.</note> in their manner of preſenting that doctrine. Religion is a ſerious thing, but not a ſullen; Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preaching is a grave exerciſe, but not a ſordid, not a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, not a negligent. There are not ſo eloquent books in the world, as the Scriptures: Accept thoſe names of Tropes and Figures, which the Grammarians and Rhetoricians put upon us,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93368:17"/>
and we may be bold to ſay, that in all their Authors, Greek and Latin, we cannot finde ſo high, and ſo lively examples, of thoſe Tropes, and thoſe Figures, as we may in the Scriptures: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hath juſtly delighted any man in any mans writings, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the Scriptures. The ſtyle of the Scriptures is a diligent, and an artificial ſtyle; and a great part thereof in a muſical, in a metrical, in a meaſured compoſition, in verſe. The greateſt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of our Religion, indeed the whole body of our Religion, the coming, and the Kingdome of a <hi>Meſsias,</hi> of a Saviour, of Chriſt, is conveyed in a Song, in the third chapt. of <hi>Habakkuk:</hi> and therefore the Jews ſay, that that Song cannot yet be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, becauſe they ſay the <hi>Meſsiah</hi> is not yet come. His greateſt work, when he was come, which was his union and marriage with the Church, and with our ſouls, he hath alſo delivered in a piece of a curious frame, <hi>Solomons</hi> Song of Songs. And ſo likewiſe, long before, when God had given all the Law, he provided, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſayes, a ſafer way, which was to give them a heavenly Song of his owne making: for that Song, he ſayes there, he was ſure they would remember.<note place="margin">Deut. 31.</note> So the Holy Ghoſt hath ſpoken in thoſe Inſtruments, whom he choſe for the penning of the Scriptures, and ſo he would in thoſe whom he ſends for the preaching there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: he would put in them a care of delivering God meſſages, with conſideration, with meditation, with preparation; and not barbarouſly, not ſuddenly, not occaſionally, not extemporarily, which might derogate from the dignity of ſo great a ſervice. That Ambaſſadour ſhould open himſelf to a ſhrewd danger and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſall, that ſhould defer the thinking upon his Oration, till the Prince, to whom he was ſent, were reading his letters of Credit: And it is a late time of meditation for a Sermon, when the Pſalm is ſinging. <hi>Loquere Domine,</hi> ſayes the Prophet; ſpeak, O Lord: But it was when he was able to ſay, <hi>Ecce paratus,</hi> Behold I am pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for thee to ſpeak in me: If God ſhall be believed, to ſpeak in us, in our ordinary Miniſtry, it muſt be, when we have, ſo as we can, fitted our ſelves, for his preſence. To end this, then are we <hi>Muſicum carmen in modo,</hi> muſick to the ſoul, in the manner of our preaching, when in delivering points of Divinity, we content our ſelves with that language, and that phraſe of ſpeech, which the Holy Ghoſt hath expreſſed himſelf in, in the Scriptures: for to delight in the new and bold termes of Hereticks, furthers the Doctrine of Hereticks too. And then alſo, are we <hi>Muſicum car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> when, according to the example of men inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt, in writing the Scriptures, we deliver the meſſages of God, with ſuch diligence, and ſuch preparation, as appertains to the dignity of that employment.</p>
            <p>Now theſe two, to be Muſick both theſe wayes,<note place="margin">Vox ſuavis.</note> in matter and in manner, concur and meet in the next, which is, to have a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93368:18"/>
voyce: <hi>Thou art a lovely ſong of one that hath a pleaſant voyce.</hi> Firſt, A Voyce they muſt have, they muſt be heard: if they ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence themſelves, by their ignorance, or by their lazineſs; if they occaſion themſelves to be ſilenced, by their contempt and contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, both wayes they are inexcuſable; for a voyce is eſſentiall to them, that denominates them: <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> hath other great names; even the name of <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> is a great name, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whom he baptized; him, who baptized the Baptiſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and all us, in his own blood. So is his name of <hi>Preacher,</hi> the fore-runner of Chriſt (for in that name he came before him, who was before the world;) ſo is his <hi>Propheta,</hi> that he was a Prophet, and then, more then a Prophet; and then, the greateſt among the ſons of women; theſe were great names, but yet the name that he choſe, is <hi>Vox clamantis, The voyce of him that cryes in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> What names and titles ſoever we receive in the School, or in the Church, or in the State; if we loſe our voice, we loſe our proper name, our Chriſtian name. But then, <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> name is not A voyce, Any voyce, but The voyce: in the Propheſie of <hi>Eſay,</hi> in all the four Evangeliſts, conſtantly, The voyce. Chriſt is <hi>verbum,</hi> The word; not A word, but The word: the Miniſter is <hi>Vox,</hi> voyce; not A voyce, but The voyce, the voyce of that word, and no other; and ſo, he is a pleaſing voyce, becauſe he pleaſes him that ſent him, in a faithfull executing of his Commiſſion, and ſpeaking according to his dictate; and pleaſing to them to whom he is ſent, by bringing the Goſpel of Peace and Reparation to all wounded, and ſcattered, and contrite Spirits.</p>

To what a dangerous ſcorn ſhall I open my ſelfe, and the ſervice of God, if I ſhall declaime againſt Uſury, and look him in the face that hath my money at uſe? One ſuch witneſs in the Congregation, ſhall out-preach the Preacher: and God ſhall uſe his tongue (perchance his malice) to make the ſervice of that Preacher uneffectual. <hi>Quam ſpecioſi pedes Evangelicantium!</hi> ſayes S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> (and he ſayes that out of <hi>Eſay,</hi> and out of <hi>Nahum</hi> too, as though the Holy Ghoſt had delighted himſelf with that phraſe in expreſſing it) How beautifull are the feet of them that preach the Goſpel!

that makes men admire, may lie in our tongues; but the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that makes men love, lies in our feet, in our actions. And ſo we have done with all the pieces that conſtitute our firſt part: God, in his promiſe to that Nation, propheſied upon us, that which he hath abundantly performed, a Miniſtry, that ſhould firſt be Trumpets, and then Muſick: Muſick, in fitting a reverent manner, to religious matter; and Muſick, in fitting an inſtrument to the voyce, that is, their Lives to their Doctrine. <hi>Eris,</hi> ſaid God here, to this Prophet, <hi>All this thou ſhalt be:</hi> and that leads us into our ſecond part.</p>

The worldly man, though it trouble him to hear thee, though it put thorns and brambles into his conſcience, yet though it be but to beget an opinion of holineſs in others, <hi>Audiet,</hi> he will hear thee.

The end of all is, that what puniſhment ſoever God reſerves for them, who never heard of the Name of his Son Chriſt Jeſus at all, or for them who have pretended to receive him, but have done it Idolatrouſly, ſuperſtitiouſly; we that have heard him, we that have had the Scriptures preached and applied to us ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhall certainly have the heavier condemnation, for having had that which they wanted: Our multiplicity of Preachers, and their aſſiduity in preaching; our true interpretation of their labours, when we doe heare, and our diligent coming, that we may hear, ſhall leave us in worſe ſtate then they found us, <hi>ſi non fecerimus,</hi> If we doe not doe that which we heare. And to doe the Goſpel, is to doe what we can for the preſervation of the Goſpel. I know what I can do, as a Miniſter of the Goſpel, and of Gods Word; out of his Word I can preach againſt Linſey-woolſey garments; out of his Word I can preach againſt plowing with an Oxe, and with an Aſſe, againſt mingling of Religions.

            <p>THis is one of thoſe ſeven Epiſtles, which <hi>Athanaſius</hi> and <hi>Origen</hi> call'd <hi>Catholick;</hi> that is, univerſal; perchance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not directed to any one Church, as ſome others are, but to all the Chriſtian world: And <hi>S. Hierom</hi> call'd them <hi>Canonical;</hi> perchance becauſe all Rules, all Canons of holy Converſation are compriz'd in theſe Epiſtles: And <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and <hi>Oecumenius</hi> call'd them <hi>Circular;</hi> perchance, becauſe as in a Circle, you cannot diſcern which was the firſt point, nor in which, the compaſs begun the Circle; ſo neither can we diſcern in theſe Epiſtles, whom the Holy Ghoſt begins withall, whom he means principally, King or Subject, Prieſt or People, Single or Married, Husband or Wife, Father or Children, Maſters or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; but Univerſally, promiſcuouſly, indifferently, they give All rules, for All actions, to All perſons, at All times, and in all places; As in this Text, in particular, which is not, by any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, or ſubſequent relation, by any connexion or coherence, directed upon any company, or any Degree of Men: for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle does not ſay, Ye Princes, nor ye people; but ye, ye in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, to all, <hi>So ſpeak ye, and ſo do, as they that ſhall be judged by the law of liberty:</hi> So theſe Epiſtles are Catholick, ſo they are Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical, and they Circular ſo. But yet, though in a Circle we know not where the compaſs began, we know not which was the firſt point; yet we know, that the laſt point of the Circle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to the firſt, and ſo becomes all one; and as much as we
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93368:21"/>
know the laſt, we know the firſt point. Since then the laſt point of that Circle, in which God hath created us to move, is a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome (for it is the kingdom of heaven) and it is a Court (for it is that glorious Court, which is the preſence of God, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of his Saints) it is a fair and a pious conception, for this Congregation, here preſent now in this place, to believe, that the firſt point of this Circle of our Apoſtle here, is a Court too; and that the Holy Ghoſt, in propoſing theſe duties in his general <hi>Ye,</hi> does principally intend, ye that live in Court, ye whom God brings ſo neer to the ſight of himſelf, and of his Court in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as that you have always the picture of himſelf, and the pourtraiture of his Court in your eyes: for a Religious King is the Image of God, and a Religious Court is a Copy of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints. And therefore be you content to think, that to you eſpecially our Apoſtle ſays here, <hi>Ye,</hi> ye who have a nearer propinquity to God, a more aſſiduous converſation with God, by having better helps then other inferior ſtations do afford (for though God be ſeen in a weed, in a worm, yet he is ſeen more clearly in the ſum) <hi>So ſpeak ye, and ſo Do, as they that ſhall be judged by the law of liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now,<note place="margin">Diviſio.</note> as the firſt Divels were in heaven (for it was not the puniſhment which they feel in Hell, but the ſin which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in heaven, which made them Divels) and yet the fault was not in God, nor in the place; ſo if the greateſt ſins be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Courts (as even in <hi>Rome,</hi> where they will needs have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Church, yet they confeſs a guilty Court) the faults are perſonal, theirs that do them, and there is no higher author of their ſin. The Apoſtle does not bid us ſay, that it is ſo in Courts; but leſt it ſhould come to be ſo, he bids us give theſe rules to Courts, <hi>So ſpeak ye, and ſo Do, as they that ſhall be judged by a law of liberty.</hi> Firſt then, here is no expreſs precept given, no direct commandment, to ſpeak: The Holy Ghoſt ſaw, there would be ſpeaking enough in Courts; for, though there may be a great ſin in ſilence, a great prevarication in not ſpeaking in a good cauſe, or for an oppreſſed perſon; yet the loweſt voice in a Court, whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf, ſpeaks a loud, and reaches far; and therefore, here is onely a rule to regulate our ſpeech, <hi>Sic loquimini,</hi> So ſpeak ye. And then, as here is no expreſs precept for ſpeaking, ſo here is no expreſs precept for Doing; The Holy Ghoſt ſaw, there would be Doing enough, buſineſs enough in Court: for, as ſilence, and halfe ſilence, whiſpering, may have a loud voice; ſo, even undoing may be a buſie Doing; and therefore, here's onely a Rule to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate our Doings too, <hi>Sic facite,</hi> So do ye. And laſtly, as there is ſpeaking enough, even in ſilence, and Doing enough, even in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing, in Court; So the Court is alwayes under judgement e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. Every diſcontented perſon that hath miſs'd his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93368:22"/>
though he have not merited it; every drunkard that is over-heat, though not with his own wine; every conjecturing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that is not within the diſtance to know the ends, or the ways of great Actions, will Judge the higheſt Counſels, and Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe Councels. The Court is under judgement enough, and they take liberty enough; and therefore here is a rule to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate our liberty, <hi>A law of liberty: So ſpeak ye, and,</hi> &amp;c. But though for the more benefit of the preſent congregation, we fix the firſt point of this Circle, that is, the principal purpoſe of the Holy Ghoſt, upon the Court; yet our Text is an Amphitheater. An Amphitheater conſiſts of two Theaters: Our Text hath two parts, in which, all men, all may fit, and ſee themſelves acted; firſt, in the obligation that is laid upon us, upon us all, <hi>Sic loquimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, ſic facite:</hi> And then in the Reaſon of this Holy diligence, and religious cautelouſneſs, <hi>Quia judicandi,</hi> Becauſe you are all to be judged, by, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which two general parts, the Obligation, and the Reaſon, flowing into many ſub-divided branches, I ſhall, I think, do better ſervice, both to your underſtandings, and to your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and to your Affections, and Conſciences, to preſent them as they ſhall ariſe anon, in their order, then to pour them out, all at once now.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Part I. <hi>Loquimini.</hi>
               </note>Firſt then, in our firſt part, we look to our Rule, in the firſt Duty, our ſpeaking; <hi>Sic loquimini,</hi> So ſpeak ye. The Comique Poet gives us a good Caution, <hi>Si ſervus ſemper conſueſcat ſilentio, fiet nequam;</hi> That ſervant that ſays nothing, thinks ill. As our <hi>Nullifidians,</hi> Men that put all upon works, and no faith; and our <hi>Soliſidians,</hi> Men that put all upon faith and no works, are both in the wrong; So there is a danger in <hi>Multi loquio,</hi> and another in <hi>Nulli loquio:</hi> He that ſpeaks over-freely to me, may be a Man of dangerous converſation; And the ſilent and reſerv'd Man, that makes no play, but obſerves, and ſays nothing, may be more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous then he: As the <hi>Romane</hi> Emperor profeſſed to ſtand more in fear of one pale man, and lean man, then of twenty that ſtudyed and purſued their pleaſures, and lov'd their eaſe, becauſe ſuch would be glad to keep things in the ſtate they then were, but the other ſort affected changes: ſo for the moſt part, he that will ſpeak, lies as open to me, as I to him; ſpeech is the Balance of converſation. Therefore, as God is not <hi>Merx,</hi> but <hi>pretium;</hi> Gold is not ware, but the price of all ware; So ſpeaking is not Doing, but yet fair ſpeaking prepares an acceptation before, and puts a value after, upon the beſt actions. God hath made other Creatures <hi>Gregalia,</hi> ſociable, beſides man; Sheep, and Deer, and Pigeons, will flock, and herd, and troup, and meet together; but when they are met, they are not able to tell one another why they meet. Man onely can ſpeak; ſilence makes it but a Herding: That that makes Converſation, is ſpeech, <hi>Qui datum deſerit, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpuit
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93368:22"/>
datorem,</hi> ſays <hi>Tertullian.</hi> He that uſes not a benefit, reproaches his Benefactor. To declare Gods goodneſs, that hath enabled us to ſpeak, we are bound to ſpeak: ſpeech is the Glue, the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſoul of Converſation, and of Religion too.</p>
            <p>Now, your <hi>converſation is in heaven;</hi> and therefore <hi>loquimini Deo,</hi> firſt ſpeak to him that is in heaven, ſpeak to God. Some of the Platonique Philoſophers thought it a profanation of God, to ſpeak to God; They thought, that when our Thoughts were made Prayers, and that the Heart flow'd into the Tongue, and that we had inveſted and apparel'd our Meditations with words, this was a kinde of Painting, and Dreſſing, and a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous diligence, that rather taſted of humane affections, then ſuch a ſincere ſervice, as was fit for the preſence of God; Onely the firſt conceptions, the firſt ebullitions and emanations of the ſoul, in the heart, they thought to be a fit ſacrifice to God, and all verball prayer to be too homely for him. But God himſelf, who is all ſpirit, hath yet put on bodily lineaments, Head, and Hands, and Feet, yea and Garments too, in many places of Scripture, to appear, that is, to manifeſt himſelf to us: And when we appear to God, though our Devotion be all ſpiritual, as he is all ſpirit, yet let us put on lineaments and apparel upon our Devotions, and digeſt the Meditations of the heart, into words of the mouth. God came to us <hi>in verbo,</hi> In the word; for Chriſt is, The word that was made fleſh. Let us, that are Chriſtians, go to God ſo, too, That <hi>the words of our mouth,</hi> as well as <hi>the Meditations of our heart,</hi> may <hi>be acceptable to him.</hi> Surely, God loves the ſervice of Prayer, or he would never have built a houſe for Prayer; And therefore we juſtly call Publique prayer, the Liturgy, <hi>Service:</hi> Love that place, and love that ſervice in that place, <hi>Prayer.</hi> They will needs make us believe, that S. <hi>Francis</hi> preached to Birds, and Beaſts, and Stones; but they will not go about to make us believe that thoſe Birds, and Beaſts, and Stones joyned with S. <hi>Francis</hi> in Prayer. God can ſpeak to all things; that's the office of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to ſpeak to others: But, of all, onely Man can ſpeak to God; and that's the office of Prayer. It is a bleſſed converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſpend time in Diſcourſe, in Communication with God. God <hi>went his way, as ſoon as he had left communing with Abraham.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 18. ult.</note> When we leave praying, God leaves us: But God left not <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> as long as he had any thing to ſay to God; And we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſomething to ſay unto him. He loves to hear us tell him, even thoſe things which he knew before; his Benefits in our Thankfulneſs, And our ſins in our Confeſſions, And our neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in our Petitions. And therefore having ſo many Occaſions to ſpeak to God, and to ſpeak of God, <hi>David</hi> ingeminates that, and his ingemination implies a wonder, <hi>O that men would</hi> (And it is ſtrange if Men will not) <hi>O that men would,</hi> ſays he more then once
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93368:23"/>
or twice, <hi>O that men would praiſe the Lord, and tell the wondrous works that he hath done for the ſons of Men!</hi> for, <hi>David</hi> determines not his precept in that, Be thankful unto him; for a Tnankfulneſs may paſs in private,<note place="margin">Pſal. 100.4.</note> But <hi>Be Thankful unto him, and ſpeak good of his name.</hi> Glorifie him in ſpeaking to him, in ſpeaking of him, in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for him.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Diis.</note>
               <hi>Loquimini Deo,</hi> ſpeak to God; And <hi>loquimini Diis,</hi> ſpeak to them whom God hath call'd Gods. As Religious Kings are bound to ſpeak to God by way of prayer; ſo thoſe who have that ſacred of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and thoſe that have that Honorable office to do ſo, are bound to ſpeak to Kings by way of Counſel. God hath made all good men <hi>partakers of the Divine Nature;</hi> They are <hi>the ſons of God,</hi> The <hi>ſeed of God;</hi> But God hath made Kings partakers of his Office, and Adminiſtration. And as between man and himſelf, God hath put a Mediator, that conſiſts of God and Man; ſo between Princes and People, God hath put Mediators too, who conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd in themſelves, retain the nature of the people (ſo Chriſt did of man) but conſider'd in their places, have fair and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable beams of his power, and influences of him upon them. And as our Mediator Chriſt Jeſus found always his Fathers ears open to him; ſo do the Church and State enter bleſſedly and ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, by theſe Mediators, into the ears of the King. Of our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator Chriſt himſelf,<note place="margin">Heb. 5.7.</note> it is ſaid, <hi>That he offered up prayers, and ſtrong cryes, and Tears;</hi> Even Chriſt was put to ſome difficulties in his Mediation for thoſe that were his; But <hi>he was heard, ſays that text, in that he feared.</hi> Even in thoſe things, wherein, in ſome emergent difficulties, they may be afraid they ſhall not, theſe Mediators are graciouſly and opportunely heard too, in the due diſcharge of their offices. That which was <hi>Davids</hi> prayer, is our poſſeſſion,<note place="margin">Pſal. 36.11.</note> our happineſs, <hi>Let not the foot of Pride come againſt us:</hi> we know there is no Pride in the Head; and becauſe there is no fault in the Hands neither, that is, in them, into whoſe hands this bleſſed Mediatorſhip is committed, by the great places of power, and Councel, which they worthily hold; the foot of pride, forraign, or home-oppreſſion, does not, ſhall not tread us down. And for the continuation of this happineſs, let me have leave to ſay, with <hi>Mordicai's</hi> humility, and earneſtneſs too, to all ſuch Mediators,<note place="margin">4.14.</note> that which he ſaid to <hi>Eſther, Who knows, whether thou beeſt not brought to this place for this purpoſe,</hi> To ſpeak that, which his ſacred and gracious ears, to whom thou ſpeakeſt, will always be well pleaſed to hear, when it is delivered by them, to whom it belongs to ſpeak it, and in ſuch humble and reſerved manner, as ſuch ſoveraign perſons as owe an account but to God, ſhould be ſpoke too? <hi>Sic loquimini Deo,</hi> So let Kings ſpeak to God, (that was our firſt) <hi>Sic loquimini Diis,</hi> So let them, whom Kings truſt, ſpeak to Kings, whom God hath called Gods, (that was our ſecond.)
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93368:23"/>
And then, a third branch in this rule of our firſt duty, is, <hi>Sic lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quimini imaginibus Dei,</hi> So ſpeak you to Gods Images, to Men of condition inferior to your ſelves; for they alſo are Images of God, as you are.</p>
            <p>And this is truely,<note place="margin">Imaginibus Dei.</note> moſt literally the purpoſe of the Apoſtle here, That you under-value no Man for his outward appearance;<note place="margin">Verſ. 2.</note> That your over-value no man for his goodly apparel, or Gold Rings; That you ſay not to a poor man, <hi>Stand thou there;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 3.</note> or if you admit him to ſit, <hi>Sit here under my footſtool.</hi> But it is a precept of Acceſſibleneſs, and of Affability; Affability, that is, A civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the City of God, and a Courtſhip of the Court of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to receive other Men, the Images of God,<note place="margin">Apoc. 3.20.</note> with the ſame eaſineſs that God receives you. God ſtands at the Door, and knocks, and ſtays our leiſure, to ſee if we will open, and let him in: Even at the door of his Beloved, he ſtood, and <hi>knocked, till his head was filled with dew, and his locks with the drops of the night.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cant. 5.2.</note> But God puts none of us to that, to which he puts himſelf, and his Chriſt: But, <hi>Knock,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and it ſhall be opened unto you;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 7.7.</note> No ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the door, opened as ſoon as you knock. The neareſt that our Expoſitors can come, to finde what it was that offended God, in <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtriking of the Rock for water, is, that <hi>he ſtrook it twice;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Num. 20.10.</note> that he did not believe that God would anſwer his expectation at one ſtriking. God is no in-acceſſible God, that he may not be come to; nor inexorable, that he will not be moved, if he be ſpoken to; nor dilatory, that he does not that he does, ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably. <hi>Daniel</hi> preſents God <hi>Antiquum Dierum,</hi> as an Old Man;<note place="margin">Ambro.</note> but that is as a Reverend, not as a froward perſon. <hi>Mens in ſermoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus noſtris habitat, &amp; gubernat verba:</hi> The ſoul of man is incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in his word; As he ſpeaks, we think he thinks: <hi>Et bonus paterfamilias, in illo primo veſtibulo aeſtimatur,</hi> ſays the ſame Father. As we believe that to be a free houſe, where there is an eaſie entrance; ſo we doubt the leſs of a good heart, if we finde cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable and courteous language. But yet there is an exceſs in this too, in this ſelf-effuſion, this pouring of a mans ſelf out, in fair, and promiſing language. Inacceſſibleneſs is the fault, which the Apoſtle aims at here: and truly the moſt inacceſſible Man that is, is the over-liberal, and profuſe promiſer: He is therefore the moſt inacceſſible, becauſe he is abſent, when I am come to him, and when I do ſpeak with him. To a retir'd, to a reſerv'd man, we do not eaſily get; but when we are there, he is there too: To an open and liberal promiſer we get eaſily; but when we are with him, he is away, becauſe his heart, his purpoſe is not there. But, <hi>ſic loquimini Deo,</hi> ſo ſpeak ye to God (that's a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance to Kings) <hi>Sic loquimini Diis,</hi> ſo ſpeak ye to them whom God hath call'd Gods (that's a remembrance to Mediators be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Kings and Subjects.) <hi>Sic loquimini Imaginibus Dei,</hi> ſo ſpeak
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93368:24"/>
ye to Gods Image, to all men (that's a remembrance to all that poſſeſs any ſuperiority over others) as that your <hi>loquimini</hi> may be accompanied with a <hi>facite,</hi> your ſaying with Doing, your good words with good actions: for ſo our Apoſtle joyns them here, <hi>So ſpeak ye, and ſo Do:</hi> and ſo we are come to our ſecond rule; from the rule of our Words, to the Rule of our Actions.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Facite.</note>
               <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was all voice, yet <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was a fore-runner of Chriſt. The beſt words are but words, but they are the fore-runners of Deeds: but Chriſt himſelf, as he was God himſelf, is <hi>Purus Actus,</hi> all Action, all Doing. Comfortable words are good cordials; They revive the ſpirits, &amp; they have the nature of ſuch occaſional phyſick: but Deeds are our food, our dyet, &amp; that that conſtantly nouriſhes us.<note place="margin">1 John 3.18.</note> 
               <hi>Non verbo,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle; Let us not love in word, nor in tongue; but in Deed, and in Truth. Not that we may not love in words; but that our Deeds are the true ſeals of that love, which was alſo love,<note place="margin">Ambroſe.</note> when it was in words. But <hi>Ne quod luxuriat in flore, attenuetur &amp; hebetetur in fructu;</hi> leſt that tree that blew early and plentifully, blaſt before it knit, ſecond your good words with acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons too. It is the Husbandry and the Harveſt of the righteous man; (as it gather'd in <hi>David</hi>) The Mouth of the righteous ſpeaketh wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:<note place="margin">Pſal. 37.30.</note> ſo we read it; there it is in the Tongue, in words onely: The Vulgar hath it, <hi>Meditatur,</hi> He Meditates it; ſo the heart is got in. But the Original, <hi>Hagah,</hi> is noted to ſignifie, <hi>fructificavit,</hi> He brings forth fruits thereof; and ſo the Hand is got in too: And when that which is well ſpoken, was well meant, and hath been well expreſſed in Action, that's the Husbandry of the righteous Man; then his Harveſt is all in. It is the way of God himſelf; <hi>Philo Judaeus</hi> notes,<note place="margin">Exod. 20.18.</note> that the people are ſaid to have ſeen the noiſe, and the voice of God; becauſe, whatſoever God ſays, it determines in Action: If we may hear God, we may ſee him; what he ſays, he does too. Therefore from that example of God himſelf, S. <hi>Gregory</hi> directs us; We muſt, ſays he, ſhew our Love, <hi>Et vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratione ſermonis, &amp; Miniſterio largitatis,</hi> what a fair reſpect in words, and what a reall ſupply in Deeds. Nay, when we look upon our pattern, that is, God, <hi>Tertullian</hi> notes well, That God prevented his own ſpeaking, by Doing; <hi>Benedicebat, quae benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciebat;</hi> firſt he made all things Good, and then he Bleſſed them, that they might be better; firſt he wrought, and then he ſpoke. And ſo Chriſts way and proceeding is preſented to us too; ſo far from not Doing when he ſpeaks, as that he Does before he ſpeaks.<note place="margin">Acts 1.1. Luke <hi>ult.</hi> 19.</note> Chriſt began to Do, and to Teach, ſays S. <hi>Luke;</hi> but firſt to Do. And He was mighty in Deeds, and in words; but firſt in Deeds. We cannot write ſo well as our Copy, to begin alwayes at Deeds, as God, and his Chriſt; But yet let us labor to write ſo fair after it, as firſt to afford comfortable words; and though our Deeds come after, yet to have them from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93368:24"/>
in our intention; and that we do them, not becauſe we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, but promiſe becauſe we love to do good, and love to lay upon our ſelves the obligation of a promiſe. The inſtrument and Organ of Nature was the eye; The Natural Man finds God in that he ſees, in the Creature. The Organ of the Law, which exalted, and rectified Nature, was the Hand; <hi>Fac hoc &amp; vives;</hi> perform the law, and thou ſhalt live. So alſo, the Organ of the Goſpel is the Ear, for faith comes by hearing; But then the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan of faith it ſelf, is the Hand too; A Hand that lays hold upon the Merits of Chriſt, for my ſelf; and a Hand that delivers me over to the Church of God, in a holy life, and exemplary Actions, for the edification of others. So that All, All from nature to Grace, determines in Action, in Doing good. <hi>Sic facite Deo,</hi> ſo do good to God, in reall aſſiſting his cauſe: <hi>Sic facite Diis,</hi> ſo do good to them, whom God hath called Gods, in reall ſecondings their religious purpoſes: <hi>Sic facite Imaginibus Dei,</hi> ſo do good to the Images of God, in reall relieving his diſtreſſed Members, as that you do all this, upon that which is made the Reaſon of all, in the ſecond part of this text, Becauſe you are to be judged by the law of liberty.</p>

               <note place="margin">Part. II. <hi>Baſil.</hi>
               </note> Our School-Maſter to teach us to ſtand upright in the laſt judgement,<note place="margin">Judicium.</note> is the Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the fear of that judgement, in this life. It is our School-maſter, and School-maſter enough. I ſaid unto the fool,<note place="margin">Pſal. 75.5.</note> thus and thus, ſays <hi>David:</hi> And I ſaid unto the wicked, thus and thus, ſays he: for, ſays he, God is the Judge: He thought it enough to enlighten the underſtanding of the fool, enough to rectifie the perverſeneſs of the wicked, if he could ſet God before them, in that Notion, as a Judge: for, this is one great benefit from the preſent contemplation of the future judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that whoſoever does truly, and adviſedly believe, that ever he ſhall come to that judgement, is at it now; He that believes that God will judge him, is Gods Commiſſioner, Gods Delegate, and, in his name, judges himſelf now. Therefore it is a uſeful miſtaking, which the <hi>Romane</hi> Tranſlation is fallen into, in this Text, in reading it thus, <hi>Sicut incipientes judicari;</hi> So ſpeak ye, and ſo Do, as they upon whom the judgement were already begun. For, <hi>Qui timet ante Chriſti Tribunal praeſentari,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aug.</note> He that is afraid to be brought to the laſt judgement, hath but one Refuge, but one Sanctuary, <hi>Aſcendat Tribunal Mentis ſuae, &amp; conſtituat ſe ante ſeip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum;</hi> Let him cite himſelf before himſelf, give evidence himſelf againſt himſelf; and ſo guilty as he is found here, ſo innocent he ſhall ſtand there. Let him proceed upon himſelf, as <hi>Job</hi> did,<note place="margin">9.28.</note> and he is ſafe; I am afraid of all my ſorrow, ſays he; Afraid that I have not ſaid enough againſt my ſelf, nor repented enough; Afraid that my ſorrows have not been ſincere, but mingled with
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93368:25"/>
circumſtances of loſs of health, or honour, or fortune, occaſioned by my ſins; and not onely, not principally for the ſin it ſelf. <hi>I am afraid of all my ſorrowes,</hi> ſayes he: but how much more then of my mirths and pleaſures? To judge our ſelves by the judgement of flatterers, that depend upon us; to judge our ſelves by the event and ſucceſs of things, (I am enriched, I am preferred by this courſe, and therefore all's well) to judge our ſelves by example of others, (others do thus, and why not I?) All theſe proceedings are <hi>Coram non Judice,</hi> all theſe are literally <hi>Praemunire</hi> caſes, for they are appellations into forraigne Juriſdictions, and forraigne Judicatures. Onely our own conſcience rectified, is a competent judge. And they that have paſſed the triall of that judgement, do not ſo much riſe to judgement at laſt, as ſtand and continue in judgement: their judgement, that is, their triall, is paſſed here; and there they ſhall onely receive ſentence, and that ſentence ſhall be, <hi>Euge bone ſerve; Well done, good and faithfull ſervant;</hi> ſince thou didſt enter into Judgement in the other world, enter into thy Maſters Joy in this. But howſo ever we be prepar'd for that judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, well, or not well; and howſoever the Judge be diſpoſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, well, or not well, there is this comfort given us here, that that judgement ſhall be <hi>per legem,</hi> by a Law, we ſhall be judged by a law of Liberty; which is our ſecond branch in this ſecond part.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Per Legem.</note>The Jews that proſecuted the Judgement againſt Chriſt, durſt not do that without pretending a Law: <hi>Habemus legem,</hi> ſay they, we have a law, and he hath tranſgreſſed that.

The Torrents, and Inundations, which invaſive Armies pour upon Nations, we are fain to call by the name of Law, <hi>The Law of Armes.</hi> No Judgement, no Execution, without the name, the colour, the pretence of Law; for ſtill men call for a Law for every Execution. And ſhall not the Judge of all the earth doe right? Shall God judge us, condemn us, execute us at the laſt day, and not by a Law? by ſomething that we never ſaw, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew, never notified, never publiſhed, and judge me by that, and leave out the conſideration of that Law, which he bound me to keep?<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.20.</note> I ask S. <hi>Pauls</hi> queſtion, <hi>Where is the diſputer of the world?</hi> Who will offer to diſpute unneceſſary things, eſpecially where Authority hath made it neceſſary to us, to forbear ſuch Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? <hi>Bleſſed are the peace-makers that command,</hi> and <hi>bleſſed are the peace-keepers that obey,</hi> and accommodate themſelves to peace, in forbearing unneceſſary and uncharitable controverſies:<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.16.</note> but, without controverſie, great is the myſtery of Godlineſs; The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle invites us to ſearch into no farther myſteries, then ſuch as may be without controverſie: the Myſtery of Godlineſſe is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controverſie; and godlineſs is, to believe that God hath given
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93368:25"/>
us a Law, and to live according to that Law. This, this godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, (that is, Knowledge and Obedience to the Law) hath the promiſes of this life, and the next too; all referr'd to his Law: for, without this, this godlineſs (which is holineſs) no man ſhall ſee God: All referr'd to a Law. This is Chriſts Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme in S. <hi>John,</hi> That we might know the <hi>onely true God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">17.3.</note> 
               <hi>and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt whom he ſent.</hi> A God commanding, and a Chriſt recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling us, if we have tranſgreſſed that Commandment. And this is the Holy Ghoſts Catechiſme in S. <hi>Paul, Deus remunerator,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11.6.</note> That we believe God to be, and to be a juſt rewarder of mans actions: ſtill all referr'd to an obedience, or diſobedience of a Law. The Myſtery of godlineſs is great, that is, great enough for our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and yet without controverſie; for, though controverſies have been moved about Gods firſt act, there can be none of his laſt act; though men have diſputed of the object of Election, yet of the ſubject of Execution there is no controverſie: No man can doubt, but that when God delivers over any ſoule actually, and by way of execution to eternall condemnation, that he delivers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that ſoule to that eternal condemnation, for breaking his Law. In this we have no other adverſary, but the over-ſad, the deſpai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſoule; and it becomes us all, to lend our hand to his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, and to pour in our Wine, and our Oyle, into his Wounds, that lies weltring and ſurrounded in the blood of his own pale and exhauſted ſoule: That ſoule, who though it can teſtifie to it ſelf, ſome endeavour in the wayes of holineſſe, yet upon ſome collateral doubts, is ſtill ſuſpicious, and jealous of God. How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten have we ſeen, that a needleſſe jealouſie and ſuſpition, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without cauſe, hath made a good body bad? A needleſſe jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie and ſuſpition of his purpoſes and intentions upon thee, may make thy mercifull God angry too. Nothing can alienate God more from thee, then to think that any thing but ſin can alienate him. How wouldſt thou have God mercifull to thee, if thou wilt be unmercifull to God himſelf? And, <hi>Qui quid tyrannicum in Deo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Baſil.</note> He that conceives any tyrannical act in God, is unjuſt to the God of Juſtice, and unmercifull to the God of Mercy. Therefore in the 17. of our Injunctions, we are commanded to arm ſad ſouls againſt Deſpaire, by ſetting forth the Mercy, and the Benefits, and the Godlineſs of Almighty God (as the word of the Injunction is, the godlineſs of God) for, to leave God under a ſuſpicion of dealing ill with any penitent ſoule, were to impute ungodlineſs to God. Therefore to that miſtaking ſoule, that diſcompoſed, that ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, and ſhrivel'd, and ravel'd, and ruin'd ſoule, to that jealous and ſuſpicious ſoule onely, I ſay, <hi>Let no man judge you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coloſſ. 2.16.</note> ſayes the Apoſtle, intruding into thoſe things which he hath not ſeene. Let no man make you afraid of ſecret purpoſes in God, which they have not, nor you have not ſeen; for, that by which
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93368:26"/>
you ſhall be judged, is the Law; that Law, which was notified, and publiſhed to you. The Law alone were much too heavy, if there were not a ſuperabundant eaſe and alleviation in that hand, that Chriſt Jeſus reaches out to us. Conſider the weight and the eaſe; and for pity to ſuch diſtruſtfull ſouls, and for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment of your owne, ſtop your devotions a little, upon this conſideration. There is <hi>Chyrographum,</hi> a hand-writing of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances againſt me;<note place="margin">14.</note> a Debt, an Obligation contracted by our firſt Parents, in their diſobedience, and falne upon me. And even that (be it but Originall ſin) is ſhrewd evidence; there's my firſt charge. But, <hi>Deletum eſt,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle there; that's blotted, that's defaced, that cannot be ſued againſt me, after Baptiſme: Nay, <hi>Sublatum, cruci affixum,</hi> it is cancel'd, it is nailed to the Croſſe of Chriſt Jeſus, it is no more ſin; in its ſelf it is; but to me, to condemnation, it is not: here's my charge, and my diſcharge for that.<note place="margin">28.15.</note> But yet there is a heavier evidence, <hi>Pactum cum inferno,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>I have made a covenant with death, and with Hell I am at an agreement;</hi> that is, ſays S. <hi>Greg. Audacter, Indeſinenter peccamus, &amp; diligendo, amicitiam profitemur:</hi> We ſin conſtantly, &amp; we ſin continually, and we ſin confidently; and we finde ſo much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and profit in ſin, as that we have made a league, and ſworn a friendſhip with ſin; and we keep that perverſe, and irreligious promiſe, over-religiouſly; and the ſins of our youth flow into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſins, when age diſables us for them. But yet there is a <hi>Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſt,</hi> in this caſe too; our covenant with death is diſanull'd (ſayes that Prophet) when we are made partakers of the death of Chriſt, in the bleſſed Sacrament. Mine actuall ſins loſe their act, and mine habituall ſins fall from me as a habit, as a garment put off, when I come to that: there's my charge, and my diſcharge for that. But yet there is worſe evidence againſt me, then either this <hi>Chyrographum,</hi> the firſt hand-writing of <hi>Adams</hi> hand, or then this <hi>pactum,</hi> this contract of mine own hand, actuall and habituall ſin (for of theſe, one is waſh'd out in water, and the other in blood, in the two Sacraments.) But then there is <hi>Lex in Membris,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.21.</note> 
               <hi>I finde a law, that when I would do good, evil is preſent with me.</hi> Sin aſſiſted by me, is now become a tyrant over me, and hath eſtabliſhed a government upon me; and there is a law of ſin, and a law in my fleſh, which after the water of Baptiſm taken, and the water of penitent teares given; after the blood of Jeſus Chriſt taken, and mine own blood given (that is, a holy readineſs at that time, when I am made partaker of Chriſts death, to die for Chriſt) throwes me back, by relapſes into thoſe repented ſins. This put the Apoſtle to that paſſionate exclamation, <hi>O wretched man that I am!</hi> And yet he found a deliverance, even from the body of this death, through Jeſus Chriſt his Lord: that is, a free, an open recourſe and acceſs to him in all oppreſſions of heart, in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93368:26"/>
all dejections of ſpirit. Now, when this <hi>Chyrographum,</hi> this bond of <hi>Adams</hi> hand, Original ſin, is cancell'd upon the Croſs of Chriſt; And this <hi>Pactum,</hi> this band of mine hand, actual ſins, waſhed away in the blood of Chriſt; and this, <hi>Lex in membris,</hi> this diſpoſition to relapſe into repented ſins (which, as a tide that does certainly come every day, does come every day in one form or other) is beaten back, as a tide by a bank, by a continual oppoſing the merits and the example of Chriſt Jeſus, and the practiſe of his faſting, and ſuch other medicinall diſciplines, as I find to prevaile againſt ſuch relapſes; when by this bleſſed means, the whole Law, againſt which I am a treſpaſſer, is evacuated, will God condemn me for all this, and not by a Law? When I have pleaded Chriſt, and Chriſt, and Chriſt; Baptiſm, and Blood, and Teares; will God condemn me an oblique way, when he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by a direct way; by a ſecret purpoſe, when he hath no law to condemn me by? Sad and diſconſolate, diſtorted and diſtracted ſoul! if it be well ſaid in the School, <hi>Abſurdum eſt diſputare, ex ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcriptis,</hi> it is an unjuſt thing in Controverſies and Diſputations, to preſs arguments out of Manuſcripts, that cannot be ſeen by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man; it were ill ſaid in thy conſcience, that God will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed againſt thee <hi>ex manuſcripto,</hi> or condemn thee upon any thing which thou never ſaw'ſt, any unrevealed purpoſe of his. Suſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſoul! ill-preſaging ſoul! Is there ſomething elſe, beſides the day of Judgement, that the Son of Man does not know? Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet ſoul! Does he not know the proceeding of that Judgement, wherein himſelf is to be the Judge? But that when he hath died for thy ſins, and ſo fulfilled the Law in thy behalfe, thou maiſt be condemned without reſpect of that Law, and upon ſomething, that ſhall have had no conſideration, no relation to any ſuch breach of any ſuch Law in thee? Intricated, intangled conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence! Chriſt tells thee of a Judgement, becauſe thou didſt not do the works of Mercy, not feed, not cloath the poor; for thoſe were enjoyned thee by a Law: But he never tells thee of any Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therefore, becauſe thy name was written in a dark book of Death, never unclaſped, never opened unto thee in thy life. He ſayes unto thee lovingly, and indulgently, Fear not, for it is Gods good pleaſure to give you the Kingdome; But he never ſayes to the wickedeſt in the world, Live in fear, dye in anxiety, in ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſuſpenſion for his diſpleaſure: a diſpleaſure conceived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, before you were ſinners, before you were men, hath thrown you out of that Kingdome into utter darkneſs. There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus; the reaſon is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, becauſe the Law of the Spirit of Life hath made them free from the Law of Sin, and of Death. All, upon all ſides, is ſtill referred to Law. And where there is no law againſt thee (as there is not to him that is in Chriſt; and he is in Chriſt, who
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93368:27"/>
hath endeavoured the keeping, or repented the breaking of the Law) God will never proceed to execution by any ſecret purpoſe never notified, never manifeſted. Suſpicious, jealous, ſcattered ſoule, recollect thy ſelf, and give thy ſelf that redintegration, that acquieſcence, which the Spirit of God, in the means of the Church offers thee: ſtudy the Myſtery of godlineſſe, which is without all controverſie; that is, endeavour to keep, repent the not keeping of the Law, and thou art ſafe; for that that you ſhall be judged by, is a Law. But then this Law is called here a Law of Liberty; and whether that denotation, that it is called a Law of Liberty, import an eaſe to us, or a heavier weight upon us, is our laſt diſquiſition, and concluſion of all: So ſpeak ye, and ſo do, as they that ſhall be judged by the Law of Liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Lex libertatis.</note>That the Apoſtle here, by the Law of Liberty, meanes the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,<note place="margin">1.25.</note> was never doubted. He had called the Goſpel ſo, before this place: <hi>Whoſo looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, ſhall be bleſſed in his deed;</hi> that is, bleſſed in doing ſo, bleſſed in conforming himſelf to the Goſpel. But why does he call it ſo, a Law of Liberty? Not becauſe men naturally affecting liberty, might be drawn to an affection of the Goſpel, by propoſing it in that ſpecious name of Liberty, though it were not ſo. The Holy Ghoſt calls the Goſpel a Pearle, and a Treaſure, and a Kingdom, and Joy, and Glory; not to allure men with falſe names, but becauſe men love theſe, and the Goſpel is truly all theſe; a Pearle, and a Treaſure, and a Kingdome, and Joy, and Glory: And it is truly a Law of Liberty. But of what kind, and in what reſpect? Not ſuch a Liberty as they have eſtabliſhed in the Roman Church, where Eccleſiaſtical Liberty muſt exempt Eccleſiaſtical perſons from participating all burdens of the State, and from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Traitors, though they commit treaſon, becauſe they are Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to no ſecular Prince: nor the liberty of the Anabaptiſts, that overthrowes Magiſtracy, and conſequently all ſubjection, both Eccleſiaſtical and Laick; for, when upon thoſe words, <hi>Be ye not ſervants of men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.23.</note> S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſayes, this is Chriſtian liberty, <hi>Nec aliis nec ſibi ſervire,</hi> neither to be ſubjects to others, nor to our ſelves; that's ſpoken with modification, with relation to our firſt Allegeance, our Allegeance to God; not to be ſo ſubject to others, or to our ſelves, as that either for their ſakes or our owne, we depart from any neceſſary declaration of our ſervice to God.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Deo.</note>Firſt then, the Goſpel is a Law of Liberty, in reſpect of the Author of the Goſpel, of God himſelf, becauſe it leaves God at his liberty. Not at liberty to judge againſt his Goſpel, where he hath manifeſted it for a Law; for he hath laid a holy neceſſity upon himſelf, to judge according to that Law, where he hath pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed that law. But at liberty ſo, as that it conſiſts onely in his
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93368:27"/>
good pleaſure, to what Nation he will publiſh the Goſpel, or in what Nation he will continue the Goſpel, or upon what perſons he will make this Goſpel effectuall. So <hi>Oecumenius</hi> (who is no ſingle witneſs, nor ſpeaks not alone, but compiles the former Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) places this liberty in God, that God is at liberty to give this Goſpel when he will; and at liberty ſo, as that he hath exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted no man, how well ſoever he love him; nor put on ſuch fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or manacles upon himſelf, but that he can and will puniſh thoſe that tranſgreſs this law. So it is a Law of liberty to God; nothing determined upon any man, nothing concluded in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, lies ſo in Gods way, as to hinder him from proceeding in his laſt judgement, according to the keeping or breaking of this law: ſtill God is at his liberty. And it is a Law of liberty in reſpect of us: of us, who are Chriſtians; and conſidered ſo,<note place="margin">Nobis.</note> either with a reſpect to the naturall man, or with a reſpect to the Jew. For, if we compare the Chriſtian with the naturall man, the law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture layes the ſame obligation upon the naturall man, as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel does upon the Chriſtian, for the morall part thereof. The Chriſtian is no more bound to love God, nor his neighbour, then the naturall man is: therein the naturall man hath no more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty then the Chriſtian; ſo far their law is equal: And then all the law which the Chriſtian hath, and the natural man hath not, is a law of liberty to the Chriſtian, that is, a law that gives him an eaſe, and a readier way to perform thoſe duties; which way the natural man hath not, and yet is bound to the ſame duties. The natural man, if he tranſgreſs that law, which he finds in his own heart, findes a condemnation in himſelf, as well as the Chriſtian; therein he is no freer then the Chriſtian: But he finds no Sanctuary, no Altar, no Sacrifice, no Church; no ſuch Liberties, as the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian does in the Goſpel. So the Goſpel is a law of Liberty to us in reſpect of the natural man, that it ſets us at liberty, reſtores us to liberty, after we are falne into priſon for debt, into Gods diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for ſin, by affording us means of reconciliation to God again.</p>
            <p>It is ſo alſo in reſpect of the Law given by God to the Jewes.<note place="margin">Judaei.</note> The Jewes had liberties, that is, refuge and help of ſacrifices for ſin; which the natural man had not: for, if the natural man were driven and followed from his own heart, that he ſaw no comfort of an innocency there, he had no other liberties to flie to, no comfort in any other thing; no law, no promiſe annexed to any other action; not to Sacrifice, as the Jewes; or to Sacrament, as the Chriſtians, but muſt irremediably ſink under the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own heart. The Jew had this liberty, a Law, and a Law that involv'd the Goſpel; but then the Goſpel was to the Jew but as a letter ſeal'd; and the Jew was but as a ſervant, who was truſted to carry the letter, as it was, ſeal'd, to another, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it to the Chriſtian. Now the Chriſtian hath received this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93368:28"/>
at the Jews hand, and he opens it; he ſees the Jewes Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie made Hiſtory to him; the Jewes hope and reverſion, made poſſeſſion and inheritance to him: he ſees the Jewes faith made matter of fact; he ſees all that was promiſed and repreſented in the Law, performed and recorded in the Goſpel, and applied in the Church.<note place="margin">John 15.15.</note> There Chriſt ſayes, <hi>Henceforth call I you not ſervants, but friends.</hi> Wherein conſiſts this enfranchiſement? In this; <hi>The ſervant knoweth not what his master doth</hi> (the Jewes knew not that) <hi>but I have called you friends,</hi> ſayes Chriſt, <hi>for all things that I heard of my Father,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hebr. 7.19.</note> 
               <hi>I have made known unto you. The Law made nothing perfect,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle. Where was the defect? he tells us that; the old Covenant (that is,<note place="margin">Galat 4.24.</note> the Law) gendreth to bondage. What bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage? he tells us that too, when he ſays, <hi>The Law was a Schoolmaſter.</hi> The Jews were as School-boys, always ſpelling, and putting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Types and Figure; which things typified and figured, how this Lamb ſhould ſignifie <hi>Chriſt,</hi> how this fire ſhould ſignifie a <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt.</hi> The Chriſtian is come to the Univerſity, from Grammar to Logick, to him that is <hi>Logos</hi> it ſelf, the Word; to apprehend &amp; apply Chriſt himſelf; and ſo is at more liberty then when he had onely a dark law, without any comment, with the natural man; or onely a dark comment, that is, the Law, with a dimme light, &amp; ill eys, as the Jews had: for though the Jew had the liberty of a Law, yet they had not the law of Liberty. So the Goſpel is a law of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to God, who is ſtill at his liberty to give and take, and to condemn according to that law; and a law of liberty to us, as we are compared to the natural man, or to the Jew. But when we confine our ſelves in our ſelves, poſitively, without compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it is not ſuch a law of liberty to us, as ſome men have come too near ſaying, That the ſins of Gods children do them no harm; that God ſees not the ſins of his children; that God was no further out with <hi>David</hi> in his Adultery, then in his Repentance: But, as to be born within the Covenant, that is, of Chriſtian Parents, does not make us Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Aug.</note> (for, <hi>Non naſcitur, ſed renaſcitur Chriſtianus</hi>) the Covenant gives us a title to the Sacrament of Baptiſme, and that Sacrament makes us Chriſtians: ſo this law of liberty gives us not a liberty to ſin, but a liberty from ſin. <hi>Noli li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertate abuti, ad libere peccandum,</hi> ſayes the ſame Father; It is not a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.17.</note> but an impotency, a ſlavery, to ſin. <hi>Voluntas libera quae pia,</hi> ſayes he, onely a holy ſoul is a free ſoul. <hi>Where the ſpirit of the Lord is there is liberty,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Leo.</note> ſayes the Apoſtle: And <hi>Splendidiſsimum in ſe quiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que habet ſpeculum,</hi> Every man hath a glaſſe, a chryſtal, into which, though he cannot call up this ſpirit (for the Spirit of God breathes where it pleaſes him) yet he can ſee this ſpirit, if he be there, in that glaſſe: every man hath a glaſſe in himſelfe, where he may ſee himſelfe, and the Image of God, ſayes that Father, and ſee how like he is to that. To dare to reflect upon my ſelfe,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93368:28"/>
and to ſearch all the corners of mine owne conſcience, whether I have rightly uſed this law of liberty; and neither been bold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a ſinne, upon preſumption of an eaſie; nor diffident after, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuſpicion of an impoſſible reconciliation to my God: this is Evangelical liberty.</p>
            <p>So then (to end all) though it be a law of Liberty, becauſe it gives us better meanes of prevention before, and of reſtitution after, then the natural man, or the Jew had; yet we conſider, that it is this law of Liberty, this law that hath afforded us theſe good helps, by which we ſhall be judged; and ſo, though our caſe be better then theirs, becauſe we have this law of Liberty, which they wanted, yet our caſe growes heavier then theirs, if we uſe it not aright. The Jewes ſhall be under a heavier condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then the natural man, becauſe they had more liberty, that is, more means of avoyding ſin, then the natural man had; and, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame reaſon, the Chriſtian under a heavier condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then either, becauſe he ſhall be judged by this law of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
            <p>What judgement then gives this law? This; <hi>Qui non crediderit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark 16.16.</note> 
               <hi>damnabitur;</hi> and ſo ſayes this Law in the Law-makers mouth, <hi>He that believes not, ſhall be damned.</hi> And as no leſſe light then Faith it ſelfe, can ſhew you what Faith is, what it is to believe; ſo no leſſe time then Damnation ſhall laſt, can ſhew you what Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is: for, the very form of Damnation is the everlaſtingneſs of it; and, <hi>Qui non crediderit, He that believeth not ſhall be damned:</hi> there's no commutation of penance, nor beheading after a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a more ignominious death, in that court. Doſt thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that thou doſt believe? yet this law takes not that anſwer: This law of Liberty takes the liberty to look farther; <hi>Through faith into works;</hi> for, ſo ſayes the Law in the mouth of the Law-maker; <hi>To whom much is given, of him much ſhall be required.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 12.48.</note> Haſt thou conſidered every new title of Honour, and every new addition of Office, every new ſtep into higher places, to have laid new Duties, and new obligations upon thee? Haſt thou doubled the hours of thy Prayers, when thy Preferments are doubled; and encreaſed thine Almes, according as thy Revenues are encreaſed? Haſt thou done ſomething, done much in this kinde? this law will not be anſwer'd ſo; this law of Liberty takes the liberty to call upon thee for all. Here alſo the Law ſayes in the mouth of the Law-maker, <hi>If thou have agreed with many adverſaries,</hi> ſayes Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mat 5.25.</note> (let that be, If thou have ſatisfied many duties) (for duties are adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, that is, temptations upon us) <hi>yet, as long as thou haſt one ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, agree with that adverſary quickly in the way;</hi> leave no duty undiſcharged, or unrepented in this life. Beloved, we have well delivered our ſelves of the feare of Purgatory; none of us feare that: but another miſtaking hath overtaken us, and we flatter
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93368:29"/>
our ſelves with another danger, that is, Compenſation, that by do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing well in one place, our ill doing in another is recompenced: an ill Officer looks to be ſav'd, becauſe he is a good husband to his wife, a good father to his children, a good maſter to his ſervants; and he thinks he hath three to one for his ſalvation. But, as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture requires the qualities of every element which thou art com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of; ſo this law of Liberty calls upon thee for the exerciſes of all thoſe vertues, that appertain to every particular place thou hold'ſt: This liberty, this law of Liberty takes; It binds thee to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Chriſt, All Chriſt; Gods Chriſt, as he was the eternal Son of the Father, God of God; our Chriſt, as he was made man for our ſalvation; and thy Chriſt, as his bleſſed Spirit, in this his Ordinance, applies him to thee, and offers him into thine armes this minute. And then, to know, that he looks for a retribution from thee, in that meaſure, in which he hath dealt with thee; much for much; and for ſeveral kinds of good, according to thoſe ſeveral good things, which he hath done for thee. And, if thou be firſt defective in theſe, and then defective in laying hold upon him, who is the propitiation and ſatisfaction for thy defects in theſe, this law of Liberty returnes to her liberty to pronounce, and he Judge to his liberty to execute that ſentence, <hi>Damnaberis,</hi> thou wilt be caſt into that priſon, where thou muſt pay the laſt farthing; thou muſt; for, Chriſt dyes not there, and therefore there they muſt lie, till there come ſuch another ranſome as Chriſt; nay, a greater ranſome then Chriſt was, for Chriſt paid no debts in that priſon. This then is the Chriſtians caſe, and this is the Abridgement of his Religion; <hi>Sic loquimini, ſic facite;</hi> to ſpeak aright, and to doe aright; to profeſs the truth, and not be afraid nor aſhamed of that; and to live according to that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: for, no man can make God the author of ſin; but that man comes as near it as he can, that makes Gods Religion a cloke for his ſin. To this God proceeds not meerly and onely by commadment, but by perſwaſion too; And, though he be not bound to do ſo, yet he does give a reaſon. The reaſon is, becauſe he muſt give account of both; both of Actions, and of Words; of both we ſhall be judged, but judged by a Law; a Law which excludes, on Gods part, any ſecret ill purpoſe upon us, if we keep his Law; a Law which excludes, on our part, all pretence of Ignorance; for no man can plead ignorance of a Law. And then, a law of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; of liberty to God: for God was not bound to ſave a man, becauſe he made him; but of his own goodneſs, he vouchſafed him a Law, by which he may be ſaved; a law of Liberty to us: ſo that there is no Epicuriſm, to doe what we liſt; no ſuch liberty as makes us Libertines; for then there were no Law; nor Stoiciſm, nor fatality, that conſtraines us to doe that we would not do, for then there were no Liberty. But the Goſpel is ſuch a law of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93368:29"/>
as delivers us, upon whom it works,<note place="margin">Serm. 4.</note> from the neceſſity of falling into the bondage of ſin before, and from the impoſſibility of recovering after, if we be falne into that bondage. And this is liberty enough; and of this liberty, our bleſſed God give us the right uſe, for his Son Chriſt Jeſus ſake, by the operation of that Holy Ghoſt, that proceeds from both.</p>

            <p>The Doctrine of the preſent Seaſon, is Mortification, Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation; and the experience of the preſent Place, where we ſtand now in Court, is, that the glory of the perſons, in whoſe preſence we ſtand, occaſions Humility in us; the more glorious <hi>they</hi> are, the humbler <hi>we</hi> are; and therefore to conſider Chriſt, as he is <hi>received into glory,</hi> is as much the way of our Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation and Mortification, as to conſider him in his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in his exinanition: At leaſt, how ſmall account ſhould we make of thoſe things which we ſuffer for Chriſt in this world, when we ſee in this Text, that in the deſcribing the Hiſtory of Chriſt from his Incarnation to his Aſcenſion, the Holy Ghoſt pretermits, never mentions, never ſeems to conſider the Paſſion of Chriſt; as though all that he had ſuffered for man, were nothing in reſpect of that he would ſuffer, if the juſtice of God had requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red any heavier ſatisfaction. The Text then is a ſufficient In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to <hi>Timothy,</hi> to whom this Epiſtle is ſent, and to us, to whom it is ſent too, that thereby we might know how to behave our ſelves in the Houſe of God, which is the Church of God, the pillar and ground of Truth; as is ſaid in the verſe immediately before the Text, to which the Text hath relation: we know how to behave our ſelves in the Church, if we know in the Text that ſuch a <hi>Myſtery of godlineſſe</hi> there is, and know what it is. Our parts therefore, are but two; Myſtery and Manifeſtation. In the firſt, the Apoſtle proceeds thus: Firſt, he recommends to us ſuch Doctrine as is without controverſie: and truly there is enough of that to ſave any ſoule, that hath not a minde to wrangle it ſelf into Hell. And then he ſayes, that this Godlineſſe, though it be without controverſie, yet it is a Myſtery, a Secret; not preſent, not obvious, not diſcernable with every eye: It is a Myſtery, and a great Myſtery; not the greateſt, but yet great, that is, great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; he that knowes that, needs no more. And then, for the ſecond part, which is the manifeſtation of the Myſtery, we ſhall look upon that by all thoſe beams, which ſhine out in this Text, <hi>Abortu ad Meridium,</hi> from Chriſts Eaſt to his Noon, from his firſt <hi>manifeſting in the fleſh,</hi> to his <hi>receiving into glory.</hi>

In any Conveyance, if any thing be interlin'd, the interlining muſt be as well teſtified, &amp; have the ſame witneſſes upon the Endorſment, as the conveyance it ſelf had. When there are traditions in the Church (as declaratory traditions there are) they muſt have the ſame witneſſes, they muſt be grounded upon the Word of God: for there onely is truth without controverſie. <hi>Pilate</hi> ask'd Chriſt, <hi>Quid veritas,</hi> what was truth;<note place="margin">John 18.38.</note> and he might have known, if he would have ſtaid; but, <hi>exicit,</hi> ſayes the Text

there, <hi>He went out,</hi> out to the Jewes; and there he could not finde it, there he never thought of it more. Ask of Chriſt ſpeaking in his Word, there you ſhall know; produce the Record, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,<note place="margin">Jude 1.3.</note> and there is <hi>Communis ſalus;</hi> I wrote unto you of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Salvation: What's that? <hi>Semel tradita ſides,</hi> ſayes that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle there: The Faith which was once delivered to the Saints: where <hi>ſemel</hi> is not <hi>aliquando;</hi> once, is not once upon a time, I cannot tell when; but <hi>ſemel</hi> is <hi>ſimul,</hi> once is at once: The Goſpel was delivered all together, and not by Poſtſcripts. Thus it is, If we go to the Record, to the Scripture: and thus it is, if we ask a Judge (I do not ſay, The Judge, but A Judge) for, the Fathers are a Judge; a Judge is a Judge, though there lie an appeal from him. And will not the Fathers ſay ſo too? <hi>Quod ubique, quod ſemper;</hi> that's common ſalvation, which hath bound the <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints;</hi> that which all Churches alwayes have thought and taught to be neceſſary to ſalvation. Ask the Record, ask that Judge, and it will be ſo; and it will be ſo, if you ask the Counſel on the other ſide. Ask the <hi>Council of Trent</hi> it ſelf, and the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of that Council will not ſay, that our Church affirmes any Errour; neither can they ſay, that we leave any truth unaffirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which the Primitive Church affirm'd to be neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For thoſe things which the Schoole hath drawn into diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſince, as their form is, in the beginning of every queſtion, to ſay, <hi>Videtur quod non,</hi> one would think it were otherwiſe; if when they have ſaid all, I return to the beginning again, <hi>Videtur quod non,</hi> I think it is otherwiſe ſtill.

               <note place="margin">Rom. 1.20.</note> and that ſhould be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of this world. The knowledge of God was manifeſted often in the Prophets; he foretold, therefore he foreſaw.

The Jews believe it not at all; and to them <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſayes enough:<note place="margin">Tertul.</note> Since out of their Prophets they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that when the <hi>Meſsias</hi> ſhall be manifeſted, they muſt for a time ſuffer many calamities in this world; if their <hi>Meſsias</hi> ſhould be manifeſted now (ſayes he) what could they ſuffer? They ſay they muſt ſuffer baniſhment; <hi>Et ubi diſperſio gentis, quae jam extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris?</hi> whither ſhall that Nation be baniſh'd, which is already in baniſhment and diſperſion? <hi>Redde ſtatum Judaeis,</hi> let the Jews ſhew me a <hi>State,</hi> a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> a <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> a <hi>Government, Magistrates, Judicatures, Merchandiſe,</hi> and <hi>Armies;</hi> let them ſhew ſomething to looſe for a <hi>Meſsias,</hi> and then let them look for a <hi>Meſsias.</hi> The Jewes are within the <hi>non omnino,</hi> they believe not this Myſtery at all: And then, for the <hi>non ſicut est,</hi> for the not believing it aright, as the old Valentinians are renewed in the Anabaptiſts (for both deny that Chriſt took fleſh of the Virgin) ſo the old Manichaeans are not renewed, but exceeded in the Tranſubſtantiators: for they ſaid the body of Chriſt was left in one place, in the Sun; theſe ſay, it is upon as many Tables, and in as many Boxes as they will. But whether the manifeſtation of God in the fleſh were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Incarnation of Chriſt; or to his Declaration, when the wiſe men of the Eaſt came to ſee him at <hi>Bethleem;</hi> whether when it was done, or when it was declared to be done, hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a queſtion, becauſe the Weſtern Church hath call'd that day of their coming to him, the <hi>Epiphany;</hi> and <hi>Epiphany</hi> is Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation. Then therefore is God manifeſted to us, when, as theſe wiſe men offer'd their Myrrhe and Frankincenſe, we offer the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Prayer; and as they offer'd their Gold, we offer our temporall wealth for the glory of Chriſt Jeſus: And when the love of him corrects in thee the intemperances of adorning thy fleſh, of pampering thy fleſh, of obeying thy fleſh, then eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is this <hi>Epiphany, God is manifeſted in the fleſh,</hi> in thy fleſh.</p>

                  <hi>Juſtificat. in ſpirit.</hi> Rom. 8.3.</note> it behooved him to be <hi>juſtified in the ſpirit;</hi> for he came <hi>in ſimilitudinem carnis peccati:</hi> they took him for a ſinner, and they ſaw him converſe with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: for any thing they could ſee, it might have been <hi>Caro peccati,</hi> ſinfull fleſh; and they ſaw enough to make them ſure that it was <hi>Caro mortis,</hi> mortall fleſh. Though he were <hi>Panis de coelo,</hi> Bread from Heaven, yet himſelf was hungry; and though he were <hi>fons perennis,</hi> an everlaſting ſpring, yet himſelf was thirſty; though he were <hi>Deus totius conſolationis,</hi> the God of all comfort,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 13.</note> yet his

ſoul was heavy unto death; and though he were <hi>Dominus vitae,</hi> the Lord of Life, yet Death had dominion over him. When therefore <hi>Chriſt was manifeſted in the fleſh,</hi> fleſh ſubject to Death, Death, which was the reward of Sin; and would take upon him to forgive ſins; it behooved him to be extraordinarily juſtified, extraordinarily declared to the world: and ſo he was; he was juſtified <hi>in Spiritu,</hi> in the Spirit; firſt, <hi>in Spiritu Sancto,</hi> in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in the Holy Ghoſt; both when the Holy Ghoſt was ſent to him, and when the Holy Ghoſt was ſent by him, from him. The Holy Ghoſt was ſent to him in his Baptiſme, and he tarried upon him: Chriſt was not, a Chriſtian is not juſtified by one acceſſe, one viſitation, one approach of the Holy Ghoſt; not by one reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious act: it is a permanency, a perſeverance that juſtifies: that fooliſhneſs, and that faſcination (as the Apoſtle calls it) that Witchcraft which he imputes to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> is not ſo worn out, but that there are fooliſh and bewitched <hi>Galatians</hi> ſtill, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in the Spirit, and will be made perfect in the Fleſh; that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd their Chriſtianity in one Church, and attend a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a better ſtate, in a worſe. Chriſt was juſtified by the Holy Ghoſt, when the Holy Ghoſt came to him: ſo he was, when he came from him, at Pentecoſt, upon his Apoſtles; and then he came in Tongues, and fiery Tongues. Chriſt was not, a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is not juſtified in ſilence, but in declarations and open profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; in tongues: and not in dark and ambiguous ſpeeches, nor infinite and retractable ſpeeches, but in fiery tongues; fiery, that is, fervent; fiery, that is, clear. He was juſtified ſo, <hi>a Spiritu Sancto;</hi> and ſo he was, <hi>a Spiritu ſuo,</hi> by his own Spirit: not onely in that proteſtation of his, <hi>Who can accuſe me of any ſin?</hi> for S. <hi>Paul</hi> could ſay that he was unreproachable in the ſight of men, and yet he could not chuſe but ſay, <hi>Quorum ego maximus;</hi> that he was the greateſt ſinner of all men. I were a miſerable man, if I could accuſe Chriſt of no ſin; if I could not prove all my ſins his, I were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a heavy condemnation. But that which we intend by his being juſtified, <hi>a ſpiritu ſuo,</hi> by his own ſpirit, is, not by the teſtimony that he gave of himſelf; but by that Spirit, that God-head, that dwelt bodily in him, and declared him, and juſtified him in that high power and practiſe of Miracles. When Chriſt came into this world, as if he had come a day before any day, a day before <hi>Moſes</hi> his <hi>in principio,</hi> before there was any creature (for when Chriſt came, there was creatures that could exerciſe any natural faculty in oppoſition to his purpoſes) when Nature his Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent gave up her ſword to his hands; when the Sea ſhut up her ſelfe like Marble, and bore him; and the Earth opened her ſelfe like a book, to deliver out her dead, to wait upon him; when the winds, in the midſt of their own roaring, could heare his voyce; and Death it ſelf, in putrid and corrupt carkaſes, could heare his
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93368:33"/>
voice; &amp; when his own body, whom his own ſoul had left &amp; aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, was not abandoned by this Spirit, by this Godhead (for the Deity departed not from the dead body of Chriſt) then was Chriſt eſpecially juſtified by this Spirit, in whoſe power he raiſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the dead; he was juſtified in <hi>Spiritu Sancto,</hi> and <hi>in ſpiritu ſuo;</hi> two witneſſes were enough for him. Adde a third for thy ſelf, <hi>&amp; justificetur in Spiritu tuo,</hi> let him be juſtified in thy ſpirit: God is ſafe enough in himſelf, and yet it was a good declaratory addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Publicans juſtified God:<note place="margin">Luke 7.29. Mat. 2.19.</note> Wiſdom is ſafe enough of her ſelf, and yet Wiſdome is juſtified of her children: Chriſt is ſufficiently juſtified; but <hi>juſtificetur in Spiritu tuo,</hi> in thy ſpirit. To ſay, If I conſider the <hi>Talmud,</hi> Chriſt may as well be the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> as any whom the Jews place their marks upon; if I conſider the <hi>Alcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> Chriſt is like enough to be a better Prophet then <hi>Mahomet;</hi> if I conſider the Arguments of the <hi>Arrians,</hi> Chriſt may be the Son of God for all that; if I conſider the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ours, he is as likely to manifeſt himſelf in his own Word here, as there in their word; to ſay but ſo, Chriſt may be God for any thing I know: this is but to baile him, not to juſtifie him; not to quit him, but to put him over to the Seſſions, to the great Seſſions, where he ſhall juſtifie himſelf; but none of them, who do not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie him, teſtifie for him, <hi>in ſpiritu ſuo,</hi> ſincerely in their ſouls: nay, that's not enough: to juſtifie is an act of declaration;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.2.</note> and no man knowes what is in man, but the ſpirit of man: and therefore he that leaves any outward thing undone, that belongs to his calling, for Chriſt, is ſo far from having juſtified Chriſt, as that at the laſt day, he ſhall meet his voice with them that cried <hi>Crucifie him,</hi> and with theirs that cried, <hi>Not Chriſt, but Barab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas:</hi> if thou doubt in thy heart, if thou diſguiſe in thine actions, <hi>non juſtificatur in ſpiritu tuo,</hi> Chriſt is not juſtified in thy ſpirit; and that's it which concernes thee moſt.</p>
            <p>Chriſt had all this teſtimony more, <hi>Viſus ab Angelis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Viſus ab An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelis.</note> he was ſeen of Angels: which is, not onely viſited by Angels, ſerv'd by Angels; waited upon by Angels: ſo he was, and he was ſo in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very paſſage, in every ſtep. An Angel told his mother, that he ſhould be born: and an Angel told the Shepherd, that he was born; and that which directed the wiſe men of the Eaſt where to finde him, when he was born, is alſo believed by ſome of the Ancients, to have been an Angel in the likeneſs of a Star. When he was tempted by the Devil, Angels came and miniſtred to him,<note place="margin">Mat. 4.2.</note> but the Devil had left him before; his own power,<note place="margin">Luke 22.43.</note> had diſſipated his.

               <note place="margin">Mat. 26.53.</note> he could have more then twelve legions of Angels to aſſiſt him; but he would not have the aſſiſtance of his own ſword: he denies

               <note place="margin">Mat. 4.6.</note> but they had an eaſie ſervice of it; for his foot never daſht, never ſtumbled, never tripp'd in any way. As ſoon as any ſtone lay in his way, an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel removed it:<note place="margin">Mat. 28.2.</note> 
               <hi>He rolled away the ſtone from the ſepulchre.</hi> There the Angel teſtified to the women that ſought him, not onely that he was not there, (that was a poor comfort) but where he was: He is gone into <hi>Galilee,</hi> and there you ſhall finde him.

               <hi>You deceive your ſelves, if you be hearers, and not doers;</hi> How far do you deceive your ſelves, if you come not half way, if you be hearers, and not believers? <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who ſpoke all upon diſguiſes, took it ill, if he were believed: he that was crucified under <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſpeaks clearly, takes it worſe, if he be not believed; for, he hath reduced all to the <hi>Tantummodo crede,</hi> onely believe, and thou art ſafe: if we take it higher or lower; either above, in hearing onely, or below, in working onely, we may miſſe. It is not enough to hear Sermons; it is not enough to live a morall honeſt life; but take it in the midſt, and that extends to all; for there is no believing without hearing, nor working without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving. Be pleaſed to conſider this great work of believing, in the matter, what it was that was to be believed: That that Jeſus, whoſe age they knew, muſt be antidated ſo far, as that they muſt believe him to be elder then <hi>Abraham:</hi> That that Jeſus, whoſe Father and Mother, and Brothers and Siſters, they knew, muſt be believed to be of another Family, and to have a Father in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place; and yet he to be as old as his Father; And to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother proceeding from him, and yet he to be no older then that perſon who proceeded from him: That that Jeſus, whom they knew to be that Carpenters Son, and knew his work, muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd to have ſet up a frame, that reached to heaven, out of which no man could, and in which any man might be ſaved: was it not as eaſie to believe, that thoſe teares which they ſaw up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his cheeks, were Pearles; that thoſe drops of Blood, which they ſaw upon his back, were Rubies: That that ſpittle, which they ſaw upon his face, was ennamel: that thoſe hands which they ſaw buffet him, were reached out to place him in a Throne: And that that Voyce which they heard cry, <hi>Crucifige, Crucifie him,</hi> was a <hi>Vivat Rex, Long live Jeſus of Nazareth King of the Jewes;</hi> As to believe, that from that man, that worm, and no man, ingloriouſly traduced as a Conjurer, ingloriouſly apprehended as a Thief, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gloriouſly executed a Traytor; they ſhould look for glory, and all

glory, and everlaſting glory? And from that melancholick man, who was never ſeen to laugh in all his life, and <hi>whoſe ſoul was heavy unto death;</hi> they ſhould look for joy, and all joy, and everlaſting joy: And for ſalvation, and everlaſting ſalvation from him, who could not ſave himſelf from the Ignominy, from the Torment, from the Death of the Croſſe? If any State, if any Convocation, if any wiſe Man had been to make a Religion, a Goſpel; would he not have propoſed a more probable, a more credible Goſpel, to mans reaſon, then this? Be pleaſed to conſider it in the manner too: it muſt be believed by preaching, by <hi>the fooliſhneſs of preaching,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle; by a few men, that could give no ſtrength to it; by ignorant men, that could give no reaſon for it; by poor men, that could give no penſions, nor preferments in it: That this ſhould be believed, and believed thus, and believed by the world, the world that knew him not; <hi>He was in the word, and the world knew him not:</hi>

               <hi>I have choſen you,</hi> ſayes Chriſt, <hi>and therefore the world hateth you:</hi> That then when <hi>Mundus totus in maligno poſitus,</hi> the world, and all the world, not onely was, but was laid in malignity and oppoſition againſt Chriſt; That then the world, and all the world, the world of Ignorance, and the world of Pride, ſhould believe the Goſpel; that then the <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> the learned and the powerfull man of the world, ſhould ſtand out no longer, but to that one Probleme, <hi>Quomodo,</hi> How can a man be born again that is old; and preſently believe, that a man might be born again even at the laſt gaſp: That then they which followed him, ſhould ſtand no longer upon their <hi>durus ſermo,</hi> that it was a hard ſaying, that they muſt <hi>eat his Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>drink his Blood,</hi> and preſently believe that there was no ſalvation, except they did eat and drink that Fleſh and Blood: That <hi>Mary Magdelene,</hi> who was not onely tempted (is there any that is not ſo?) but overcom with the temptations (and how many are ſo!) and poſſeſſed, and poſſeſſed with ſeven Devils, ſhould preſently hearken after the powerfull charm of the Goſpel, and preſently believe that ſhe ſhould be welcom into his arms, after all her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions: that the world, this world, all this world, ſhould believe this,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.33.</note> and believe it thus; This was the Apoſtles <hi>Altitudo divitiarum,</hi> the depth of the riches of Gods wiſdom:<note place="margin">Epheſ. 3.18.</note> And this is his <hi>Longitudo,</hi> and <hi>Latitudo,</hi> the breadth, and length, and heighth, and depth, which no man can comprehend. <hi>Theudas</hi> roſe up, <hi>dicens ſe eſſe ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quem,</hi>

Chriſt Jeſus roſe up, and ſaid himſelf not to be ſome body, nor ſome great body; but that there was no body elſe, no other name given under Heaven, whereby we ſhould be ſaved; and was believ'd. And therefore, if any man
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93368:36"/>
think to deſtroy this generall, by making himſelf a wofull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to the contrary; Chriſt is not believ'd in all the world, for I never believ'd in Chriſt; ſo poore an objection, requires no more anſwer, but that that will ſtill be true in the generall; Man is a reaſonable creature, though he be an unreaſonable man.</p>
            <p>Now when he was thus preached to the Gentiles,<note place="margin">Receptus in gloria.</note> and thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in the world, that is, meanes thus eſtabliſhed, for believing in him, he had done all that he had to do here, and therefore, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptus in gloria,</hi> he was received into glory: He was received, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, taken; therefore he did not vaniſh away; he had no airy, no imaginary, no fantaſticall body; he was true man: and then he was received, re-aſſumed, taken again, and ſo was in glory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and therefore was true God. This which we are fain to call <hi>glory,</hi> is an inexpreſſible thing, and an incommunicable: <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I will not give my glory unto another,</hi> ſays God, in <hi>Iſaiah.</hi>

great Titles have been taken, Ambition goes far; and great given, Flattery goes as far; greater then this in the Text, perchance have; but it hath not fallen within my narrow reading, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that ever Prince took, that ever ſubject gave this Title, <hi>Gloria noſtra,</hi> or <hi>veſtra; May it pleaſe your Glory,</hi> or, <hi>It hath ſeem'd good to our Glory.

As long as that ſcurff, that leproſie ſticks to every thing in this world, <hi>Vanitas, Vanitatum, that all is vanity;</hi> can any glory in any thing of this world, be other then vain-glory? What Title of Honour hath any man had in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny State, in Court, that ſome priſon in that State hath not had men of that Title in it? Nay, what Title hath any Heraulds Book, that <hi>Lucifers</hi> Book hath not? Or who can be ſo great in this World, but that as great as he have periſhed in the next? As <hi>it is not good for men to eat much honey;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 25.27.</note> ſo, for men to ſearch their own glory, is not glory. Crowns are the Emblems of Glory; and Kings out of their abundant Greatneſs and Goodneſs, derive and diſtribute Crowns to Perſons of Title; and by thoſe Crowns, and thoſe Titles, they are <hi>Conſanguinei Regis,</hi> the Kings Couſins. Chriſt Jeſus is crowned with glory in Heaven, and he ſheds down Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets upon you; Honour, and Bleſſings here, that you might be <hi>Conſanguinei Regis;</hi> contract a ſpiritual Kindred with that King, and be <hi>idem Spiritus cum Domino,</hi> as inſeparable from his Father, as he himſelf is. The glory of Gods Saints in Heaven, is not ſo much to have a Crown, as to lay down that Crown at the Feet of the Lamb. The glory of good men here upon earth, is not ſo much to have Honour, and Favour, and Fortune, as to employ thoſe Beams of Glory, to his glory that gave them. In our poor calling, God hath given us grace; but <hi>grace for grace,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaies, that is, grace to derive, and convey, and ſeal grace to you. To thoſe of higher Rank, God hath given glory; and <hi>glory for glory;</hi> glory therefore to glorifie him, in a care of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And becauſe he dwells in <hi>luce inacceſsibili,</hi> in a glorious light which you cannot ſee here; glorifie him in that wherein you may ſee him, in that wherein he hath manifeſted himſelf; glorifie him in his glorious Goſpel: employ your Beams of Glory, Honour, Favour, Fortune, in tranſmitting his Goſpel in the ſame glory to your Children, as you receiv'd it from your Fathers: for in this conſiſts this Myſtery of Godlineſs, which is, Faith with a pure Conſcience: And in this lies your beſt Evidence, That you are already co-aſſumed with Chriſt Jeſus into glory, by having ſo laid an unremoveable hold upon that Kingdom which he hath purchaſed for you, with the ineſtimable price of his incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Blood.

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Cor fixum.</note>Firſt then, We bind our ſelves to the ſtake, to the ſtalk, to the ſtaff, the ſtem of this Symbolical Letter, and conſider in it, That firmneſs and fixation of the Heart, which God requires. God requires no unnatural things at mans hand: Whatſoever God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of man, man may finde imprinted in his own nature, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his own heart. This firmneſs then, this fixation of the heart, is natural to man: Every man does ſet his heart upon ſomething: and Chriſt in this place does not ſo much call upon him, that he would do ſo, ſet his heart upon ſomething; as to be ſure that he ſet it upon the right Object. And yet truly, even this firſt work, to recollect our ſelves, to recapitulate our ſelves, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble and muſter our ſelves, and to bend our hearts intirely and intenſly, directly, earneſtly, emphatically, energetically, upon ſomething, is, by reaſon of the various fluctuation of our corrupt nature, and the infinite multiplicity of Objects, ſuch a Work as man needs to be called upon, and excited to do it. Therefore is
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93368:38"/>
there no word in the Scriptures ſo often added to the heart, as that of intireneſs; <hi>Toto Corde, Omni Corde, Pleno Corde:</hi> Do this with <hi>all thine heart,</hi> with a <hi>whole heart,</hi> with a <hi>full heart:</hi> for whatſoever is indiviſible, is immoveable; a Point, becauſe it cannot be divided, cannot be moved: the Centre, the Poles, God himſelf, becauſe he is indiviſible, is therefore immoveable. And when the heart of man is knit up in ſuch an intireneſs upon one Object, as that it does not ſcatter, nor ſub-divide it ſelf; then, and then onely is it fixed. And that's the happineſs in which <hi>David</hi> fixes himſelf; not in his <hi>Cor paratum, My heart is prepared, O God, my heart is prepared;</hi> (for ſo it may be, prepared even by God himſelf, and yet ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſubdivided by us:) But, in his <hi>Cor fixum, My heart is fixed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 57.7.</note> 
               <hi>O God, my heart is fixed; Awake my glory, awake my Pſaltery and Harp: I my ſelf will awake early, and praiſe thee, O Lord, among the people.</hi> A Triumph that <hi>David</hi> return'd to more then once: for he repeats the ſame words, with the ſame pathetical earneſtneſs again.<note place="margin">Pſal. 108.1.</note> So that his Glory, his Victory, his Triumph, his Peace, his Acquieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, his All-ſufficiency in himſelf, conſiſted in this, That his heart was fixed: for this fixation of the heart, argued and teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an intireneſs in it. When God ſayes, <hi>Fili, da mihi Cor; My Son, give me thy heart;</hi> God means, the whole man.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.17.</note> Though the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſay, <hi>The eye is not the man, nor the ear is not the man;</hi> he does not ſay, The heart is not the man: the heart is the man; the heart is all: and,<note place="margin">Exod. 10.8.</note> as <hi>Moſes</hi> was not ſatisfied with that Commiſſion that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> offered him, That all the men might go to offer ſacrifice; but <hi>Moſes</hi> would have all their young, and all their old; all their ſons, and all their daughters; all their flocks, and all their herds; he would have all: So, when Gods ſayes, <hi>Fili, da mihi Cor, My Son, give me thy heart,</hi> God will not be ſatisfied with the eye, if I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template him in his Works: (for that's but the godlineſs of the natural man) nor ſatisfied with the ear, with hearing many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: (for that's but a new invention, a new way of making Beads, if, as the Papiſt thinks all done, if he have ſaid ſo many <hi>Aves,</hi> I think all done, if I have heard ſo many Sermons.) But God requires the heart, the whole man, all the faculties of that man: for onely that that is intire, and indiviſible, is immovable; and that that God calls for, and we ſeek for, in this ſtem of <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> his Symbolical Letter, is this immovableneſs, this fixation of the heart. And yet, even againſt this, though it be natural, there are many impediments: We ſhall reduce them to a few; to three; theſe three. Firſt, there is <hi>Cor nullum,</hi> a meer Heartleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, no Heart at all, Incogitancy, Inconſideration: and then there is <hi>Cor &amp; Cor, Cor duplex,</hi> a double Heart, a doubtful, a diſtracted Heart; which is not Incogitancy, nor Inconſideration, but Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity and Irreſolution: and laſtly, <hi>Cor vagum,</hi> a wandring, a way faring, a weary Heart; which is neither Inconſideration, nor
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93368:39"/>
Irreſolution, but Inconſtancie. And this is a Trinity againſt our Unity; three Enemies to that fixation and intireneſs of the Heart, which God loves: Inconſideration, when we do not De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; Irreſolution, when we do not Determine; Inconſtancy, when we do not Perſevere: and upon each of theſe, be pleas'd to ſtop your Devotion, a few minutes.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Cor nullum.</note>The firſt is, <hi>Cor nullum,</hi> no Heart at all, Incogitancy, Thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs. An idle body, is a diſeaſe in a State; an idle ſoul, is a monſter in a man.<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 3.10.</note> 
               <hi>That body that will not work, muſt not eat,</hi> but ſtarve: that ſoul that does not think, not conſider, cannot be ſaid to actuate, (which is the proper operation of the ſoul) but to eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate; not to work in the body, but to breathe, and ſmoak through the body. We have ſeen Eſtates of private men waſted by Inconſideration, as well as by Riot; and a ſoul may periſh by a thoughtleſneſs, as well as by ill thoughts: God takes it as ill to be ſlighted, as to be injur'd: and God is as much ſlighted <hi>in Corde nullo,</hi> in our thoughtleſneſs and inconſideration, as he is oppos'd and provok'd <hi>in Corde maligno,</hi> in a rebellious Heart. There is a good nullification of the heart, a good bringing of the heart to nothing. For the fire of Gods Spirit may take hold of me, and (as the Diſciples that went with Chriſt to <hi>Emmaus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 24.</note> were affected) <hi>my heart may burn within me,</hi> when the Scriptures are opened, that is, when Gods Judgements are denounced againſt my Sin; and this heat may overcome my former frigidity and coldneſs, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome my ſucceeding tepidity and lukewarmneſs, and may bring my heart to a mollification,<note place="margin">23.16.</note> to a tenderneſs, as <hi>Job</hi> found it; <hi>The Almighty hath troubled me, and made my heart ſoft:</hi> for there are hearts of clay, as well as hearts of wax; hearts, whom theſe fires of God, his Corrections, harden. But if theſe fires of his, theſe denunciations of his judgements, have overcome firſt my coldneſs, and then my lukewarmneſs, and made my heart ſoft for better impreſſions; the work is well advanc'd, but it is not all done: for Metal may be ſoft, and yet not fuſil; Iron may be red hot, and yet not apt to run into another mold. Therefore there is a liquefaction, a melting, a pouring out of the heart, ſuch as <hi>Rahab</hi> ſpeaks of,<note place="margin">2.11. &amp; 5.1.</note> to <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s Spies; <hi>(As ſoon as we heard how miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly God had proceeded in your behalf, in drying up Jordan, all our hearts melted within us, and no man had any ſpirit left in him.)</hi> And when upon the conſideration of Gods miraculous Judgements or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, I come to ſuch a melting and pouring out of my heart, that there be no ſpirit, that is, none of mine own ſpirit left in me; when I have ſo exhauſted, ſo evacuated my ſelf, that is, all confidence in my ſelf, that I come into the hands of my God, as pliably, as ductily, as that firſt clod of earth, of which he made me in <hi>Adam,</hi> was in his hands, in which clod of earth, there was no kinde of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctation againſt Gods purpoſe; this is a bleſſed nullification of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93368:39"/>
the heart. When I ſay to my ſelf, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> profeſſed of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>I am nothing;</hi> and then ſay to God, Lord, though I be nothing,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.11.</note> yet behold, I preſent thee as much as thou hadſt to make the whole world of; O Thou that mad'ſt the whole world of nothing, make me, that am nothing in mine own eyes, a new Creature in Chriſt Jeſus: This is a bleſſed nullification, a glorious annihilation of the heart. So is there alſo a bleſſed nullification thereof, in the contrition of heart, in the ſenſe of my ſins; when, as a ſharp winde may have worn out a Marble Statue, or a continual ſpout worn out a Marble Pavement, ſo, my holy tears, made holy in his Blood that gives them a tincture, and my holy ſighs, made ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that Spirit that breathes them in me, have worn out my Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Heart, that is, the Marbleneſs of my heart, and emptied the room of that former heart, and ſo given God a <hi>Vacuity,</hi> a new place to create a new heart in. But when God hath thus created a new heart, that is, re-enabled me, by his Ordinance, to ſome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly function, then, to put this heart to nothing, to think nothing, to conſider nothing; not to know our age, but by the Church-Book, and not by any action done in the courſe of our lives, for our God, for our Prince, for our Country, for our Neighbor, for our Selves, (our ſelves are our ſouls;) not to know the ſeaſons of the year, but by the fruits which we eat, and not by obſervation of the Publick and National Bleſſings, which he hath ſucceſſively given us; not to know Religion, but by the Conveniency, and the Preferments to be had in this, or in the other ſide; to ſit here, and not to know if we be ask'd upon a ſurprize, whether it were a Prayer, or a Sermon, or an Anthem that we heard laſt; this is ſuch a nullifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the heart, ſuch an annihilation, ſuch an exinanition thereof, as reflects upon God himſelf: for, <hi>Reſpuit datorem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tertul.</note> 
               <hi>qui datum deſerit,</hi> He that makes no uſe of a Benefit, deſpiſes the Benefactor. And therefore, <hi>A rod for his back,</hi> qui indiget Corde,<note place="margin">Prov. 10.13.</note> 
               <hi>that is without a heart,</hi> without conſideration what he ſhould do; nay, what he does. For this is the firſt Enemy of this firmneſs and fixation of the heart, without which, we have no treaſure; And we have done with that, <hi>Cor nullum,</hi> and paſs to the ſecond, <hi>Cor &amp; Cor, Cor duplex,</hi> the double, the divided, the diſtracted heart, which is not Inconſideration, but Irreſolution.</p>
            <p>This Irreſolution,<note place="margin">Cor Duplex.</note> this Perplexity is intended in that Commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God, <hi>The Lord ſhall give them a trembling heart:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 28.65.</note> this is not that <hi>Cor nullum,</hi> that melted heart, in which <hi>There was no ſpirit left in them,</hi> as in <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s time; but <hi>Cor pavidum,</hi> a heart that ſhould not know where to ſettle, nor what to wiſh; but, as it follows there, <hi>In the morning he ſhall ſay, Would God it were evening; and in the evening, Would God it were morning.</hi> And this is that which <hi>Solomon</hi> may have intended in his Prayer, <hi>Give thy ſervant an underſtanding heart:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Reg. 3.9.</note> 
               <hi>Cor Docile,</hi> ſo S. <hi>Hierom</hi> reads it, A heart able to conceive counſel:
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93368:40"/>
for that's a good diſpoſition, but it is not all: for, the Original is, <hi>Leb ſhemmeany,</hi> that is, <hi>Cor audiens,</hi> A heart willing to hearken to Counſel. But all that, is not all that is ask'd; <hi>Solomon</hi> asks there <hi>a heart to diſcern between good and evil;</hi> ſo that it is a Prayer for the ſpirit of Diſcretion, of Concluſion, of Reſolution; that God would give him a heart willing to receive Counſel, and a heart ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to conceive and digeſt Counſel, and a heart able to diſcern between Counſel and Counſel, and to Reſolve, Conclude, Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. It were a ſtrange ambitious patience in any man, to be content to be racked every day, in hope to be an inch or two taller at laſt: ſo is it for me, to think to be a dram or two wiſer, by hearkning to all jealouſies, and doubts, and diſtractions, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities, that ariſe in my Boſom, or in my Family; which is the rack and torture of the ſoul. A ſpirit of Contradiction may be of uſe in the greateſt Counſels; becauſe thereby matters may be brought into farther debatement. But a ſpirit of contradiction in mine own Boſome, to be able to conclude nothing, reſolve no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, determine nothing, not in my Religion, not in my Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but occaſionally, and upon Emergencies; this is a ſickly complexion of the ſoul, a dangerous impotencie, and a ſhrewd and ill-preſaging <hi>Criſis.</hi> If <hi>Joſhua</hi> had ſuſpended his aſſent of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Lord, till all his Neighbours, and their Families, all the Kings and Kingdoms about him, had declar'd theirs the ſame way, when would <hi>Joſhua</hi> have come to that proteſtation, <hi>I and my houſe will ſerve the Lord?</hi> If <hi>Eſther</hi> had forborn to preſs for an audience to the King, in the behalf, and for the life of her Nation, till no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could have been ſaid againſt it, when would <hi>Eſther</hi> have come to that proteſtation, <hi>I will go; and if I periſh, I periſh?</hi> If one Milſtone fell from the North-Pole, and another from the South, they would meet, and they would reſt in the Centre; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would con-centre them. Not to be able to con-centre thoſe doubts, which ariſe in my ſelf, in a reſolution at laſt, whether in Moral or in Religious Actions, is rather a vertiginous giddineſs, then a wiſe circumſpection, or warineſs. When God prepar'd great Armies,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 11.7.</note> it is expreſſed always ſo, <hi>Tanquam unus vir, Iſrael went out, as one man.</hi> When God eſtabliſhed his beloved <hi>David</hi> to be King,<note place="margin">1 Chro. 12.38.</note> it is expreſſed ſo; <hi>Uno Corde,</hi> He ſent them out, with <hi>one heart, to make David king.</hi> When God accelerated the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Church,<note place="margin">Act. 4.32.</note> it is expreſſed ſo; <hi>Una Anima, The multitude of them that believed, were of one heart, and one ſoul.</hi> Since God makes Nations, and Armies, and Churches One heart, let not us make one heart two, in our ſelves; a divided, a diſtracted, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, an irreſolved heart: but in all caſes, let us be able to ſay to our ſelves, This we ſhould do. God asks the heart, a ſingle heart, an intire heart; for, whilſt it is ſo, God may have ſome hope of it. But when it is a heart and a heart, a heart for God, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93368:40"/>
a Heart for <hi>Mammon,</hi> howſoever it may ſeem to be even, the odds will be on <hi>Mammons</hi> ſide againſt God; becauſe he preſents Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, and God but Reverſions; he the preſent and poſſeſſory things of this world, God but the future, and ſperatory things of the next. So then, the <hi>Cor nullum,</hi> no heart, Thoughtleſneſs, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogitancie, Inconſideration; and the <hi>Cor duplex,</hi> the perplexed, and irreſolved, and inconcluſive heart, do equally oppoſe this firmneſs and fixation of the heart which God loves, and which we conſider in this ſtem and ſtalk of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his Symbolical Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: And ſo does that which we propos'd for the Third, The <hi>Cor Vagum,</hi> The Wandering, the Wayfaring, the Inconſtant Heart.</p>
            <p>Many times, in our private Actions,<note place="margin">Cor Vagum.</note> and in the cribration and ſifting of our Conſciences, (for that's the Sphere I move in, and no higher) we do overcome the firſt difficulty, Inconſideration; we conſider ſeriouſly: and ſometimes the ſecond, Irreſolution; we reſolve confidently: but never the third, Inconſtancie: if ſo far, as to bring holy Reſolutions into Actions; yet never ſo far, as to bring holy Actions into Habits. That word which we read <hi>Deceitful, (The heart is deceitful above all things; who can know it?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 17.9:</note>) is in the Original, <hi>Gnacob;</hi> and that is, not onely <hi>Fraudulentum,</hi> but <hi>Verſipelle,</hi> deceitful becauſe it varies it ſelf into divers forms; ſo that it does not onely deceive others (others finde not our heart the ſame towards them to day, that it was yeſterday) but it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives our ſelves; we know not what, nor where our heart will be hereafter. Upon thoſe words of <hi>Iſaiah, Redite prevaricatores ad Cor; Return, O ſinner, to thy heart: Longe eos mittit,</hi> ſays S. <hi>Gregory,</hi>
               <note place="margin">46.8.</note> God knows whither that ſinner is ſent, that is ſent to his own heart: for, Where is thy heart? Thou mayſt remember where it was yeſterday; at ſuch an Office, at ſuch a Chamber: But yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days affections are chang'd to day, as to days will be, to morrow. <hi>They have deſpiſed my judgements;</hi> ſo God complaines in <hi>Ezekiel;</hi>
               <note place="margin">20.16.</note> that is, They are not mov'd with my puniſhments; they call all, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural accidents: and then it follows, <hi>They have polluted my ſabbaths;</hi> they are come to a more faint, and dilute, and indifferent way, in their Religion. Now what hath occaſion'd this neglecting of Gods judgements, and this diluteneſs and indifferency in the ways of Religion? That that follows there, <hi>Their hearts went af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Idols:</hi> Went? Whither? Every whither: for,<note place="margin">Hierom.</note> 
               <hi>Quot vitia tot recentes deos;</hi> ſo many habitual Sins, ſo many Idols: And ſo, every man hath ſome Idol, ſome ſuch Sin; and then, that Idol ſends him to a further Idol, that Sin to another: for, every Sin needs the aſſiſtance, and countenance of another ſin, for diſguiſe and palliation. We are not conſtant in our Sins, much leſs in our more holy Purpoſes. We complain, and juſtly, of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that ſhe would not have us receive <hi>in utraque,</hi> in both kinds:
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93368:41"/>
But, alas! who amongſt us, does receive <hi>in utraque,</hi> ſo, as that when he receives Bread and Wine, he receives with a true ſorrow for former, and a true reſolution againſt future ſins? Except the Lord of heaven create new hearts in us, of our ſelves, we have <hi>Cor nullum,</hi> no heart; all vaniſhes into Incogitancy. Except the Lord of heaven con-centre our affections, of our ſelves, we have <hi>Cor &amp; Cor,</hi> a cloven, a divided heart, a heart of Irreſolution. Except the Lord of heaven fix our Reſolutions, of our ſelves, we have <hi>Cor vagum,</hi> a various, a wandering heart; all ſmoaks into Inconſtancie. And all theſe three are Enemies to that firmneſs, and fixation of the heart, which God loves, and we ſeek after. But yet how variouſly ſoever the heart do wander, and how little a while ſoever it ſtay upon one Object; yet, that that thy heart does ſtay upon, Chriſt in this place calls thy Treaſure: for, the words admit well that inverſion; <hi>Where your Treaſure is, there will your heart be alſo,</hi> implies this; Where your Heart is, that is your Treaſure. And ſo we paſs from this ſtem and ſtalk of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his Symbolical Letter, The firmneſs and fixation of the Heart, to the Horns and Beams thereof: A broader, (but on the left hand) and in that, the corruptible treaſures of this world; and a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower, (but on the right hand) and in that, the everlaſting Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the next. On both ſides, that that you fix your Heart upon, is your Treaſure: <hi>For, where your Heart is, there is your Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure alſo.</hi>

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93368:42"/>
me beſeech you, not to call the denouncing of Gods Indignation, a Satyr of a Poet, or an Invective of an Orator: As <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>There is a time for all things;</hi> there is a time for Conſternation of Preſumptuous Hearts, as well as for Redintegration of Broken Hearts; and the time for that, is this time of Mortification, which we enter into, now. Now therefore, let me have leave to ſay, That the Indignation of God is ſuch a thing, as a man would be affraid to think he can expreſs it, affraid to think he does know it: for the knowledge of the Indignation of God, implies the ſenſe and feeling thereof: all knowledge of that, is experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; and that's a woful way, and a miſerable acquiſition, and purchaſe of knowledge. To re-collect, Treaſure is Proviſion for the future: No worldly thing is ſo; there is no certain future: for the things of this world paſs from us; we paſs from them; the world it ſelf paſſes away to nothing. Yet a way we have found to make a treaſure, a treaſure of ſin; and we teach God thrift and providence: for, when we arm, God arms too; when we make a treaſure, God makes a treaſure too; a treaſure furniſhed with Weapons of Diſpleaſure for this World, and Weapons of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation for the World to come. But then, <hi>As an evil man, out of the evil treaſure of his heart, bringeth forth that which is evil; ſo,</hi> (ſays our Saviour) <hi>the good man, out of the good treaſure of his heart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 6.45.</note> 
               <hi>bringeth forth that which is good:</hi> Which is the laſt ſtroke that makes up <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his Symbolical Letter, that Horn, that Beam thereof, which lies on the right hand; a narrower way, but to a better Land; thorow Straights; 'tis true; but to the <hi>Pacifique</hi> Sea, The conſideration of the treaſure of the Godly Man in this VVorld, and Gods treaſure towards him, both in this, and the next.</p>
            <p>Things dedicated to God, are call'd often, <hi>The treaſures of God;</hi>

               <hi>Theſauri Dei,</hi> and <hi>Theſauri ſanctorum Dei:</hi> the treaſures of God, and the treaſures of the ſervants of God, are, in the Scriptures, the ſame thing; and ſo a man may rob Gods treaſury, in robbing an Hoſpital. Now, though to give a Talent, or to give a Jewel, or to give a conſiderable proportion of Plate, be an addition to a treaſury; yet to give a treaſury to a treaſury, is a more precious, and a more acceptable preſent; as to give a Library to a Library, is more then to give the works of any one Author. A godly man is a Library in himſelf, a treaſury in himſelf, and therefore fitteſt to be dedicated and appropriated to God. Inveſt thy ſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with this treaſure of Godlineſs: VVhat is Godlineſs? Take it in the whole compaſs thereof, and Godlineſs is nothing but the fear of God: for, he that ſays in his firſt Chapter,<note place="margin">Prov. 1.7.</note>

               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.19.</note> And therefore, <hi>Theſaurizate vobis fundamentum, Lay up in ſtore for your ſelves a good foundation againſt the time to come.</hi> Do all in the fear of God: In all warlike preparations, remember the Lord of Hoſts, and fear him; In all Treaties of Peace, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Prince of Peace, and fear him; In all Conſultations, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Angel of the great Council, and fear him: fear God as much at Noon, as at Midnight; as much in the Glory and Splendour of his Sun-ſhine, as in his darkeſt Eclipſes: fear God as much in thy Proſperity, as in thine Adverſity; as much in thy Preferment, as in thy Diſgrace. Lay up a thouſand pound to day, in comforting that oppreſſed ſoul that ſues; and lay up ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pound to morrow, in paring his Nails that oppreſſes: Lay up a million one day, in taking Gods Cauſe to heart; and lay up ten millions next day, in taking Gods Cauſe in hand. Let every ſoul lay up a peny now, in reſiſting a ſmall temptation; and a ſhilling anon, in reſiſting a greater; and it will grow to be a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, a treaſure of Talents, of ſo many Talents, as that the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſoul in the Congregation, would not change treaſure with any Plate-Fleet, nor <hi>Terra-firma</hi> Fleet, nor with thoſe three thouſand millions, which (though it be perchance a greater ſum then is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face of <hi>Europe,</hi> at this day, after a hundred years embowel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the earth for treaſure) <hi>David</hi> is ſaid to have left for the treaſure of the Temple,<note place="margin">

For, as the wicked make themſelves a treaſure of ſin and vanity, and then God opens upon them a treaſure of his Diſpleaſure here, and his Indignation hereafter: So the Godly make themſelves a treaſure of the fear of God, and he opens unto them a treaſure of Grace and Peace here, and a treaſure of Joy and Glory hereafter.

               <hi>We have treaſure,</hi> though <hi>in earthen Veſſels,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle. <hi>We have;</hi> that is, We have already the treaſure of Grace, and Peace, and Faith, and Juſtification, and Sanctification: But yet, <hi>in earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Veſſels,</hi> in Veſſels that may be broken; Peace that may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted,

Grace that may be reſiſted, Faith that may be enfee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, Juſtification that may be ſuſpected, and Sanctification that may be blemiſhed. But we look for more; for Joy, and Glory; for ſuch a Juſtification, and ſuch a Sanctification, as ſhall be ſeal'd, and riveted in a Glorification. Manna putrified if it were kept by any man, but a day; but in the Ark, it never putrified. That treaſure, which is as Manna from Heaven, Grace, and Peace, yet, here, hath a brackiſh taſte: when Grace, and Peace, ſhall become Joy and Glory in Heaven, there it will be ſincere. <hi>Sordeſcit quod inferiori miſcetur naturae,</hi>

He puts his Example in Silver and Gold; Though Silver be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Metal, yet it abaſes Gold. Grace, and Peace, and Faith, are precious parts of our Treaſure here; yet, if we mingle them, that is, compare them with the Joys, and Glory of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; if we come to think, That our Grace, and Peace, and Faith here, can no more be loſt, then our Joy and Glory there; we abaſe, and over-allay thoſe Joys, and that Glory. <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven is like to a Treaſure,</hi> ſays our Saviour.<note place="margin">Matth. 13.44.</note> But is that all? Is any Treaſure like unto it? None: For, (to end where we begun) Treaſure is <hi>Depoſitum in Craſtinum,</hi> Proviſion for to morrow. The treaſure of the worldly man is not ſo; He is not ſure of any thing to morrow. Nay, the treaſure of the Godly man is not ſo in this world; He is not ſure, that this dayes Grace, and Peace, and Faith, ſhall be his to morrow. When I have Joy and Glory in Heaven, I ſhall be ſure of that, to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. And that's a term long enough: for, before a to morrow, there muſt be a night; And ſhall there ever be a night in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? No more then day in Hell.<note place="margin">Apoc. 21.23.</note> 
               <hi>There ſhall be no Sun in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> therefore no danger of a Sun-ſet. And for the treaſure it ſelf, when the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> hath told us,<note place="margin">18.</note> That the Walls and Streets of the City are pure Gold, That the Foundations thereof are all precious Stones, and every Gate of an intire Pearl; what hath the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> himſelf left to denote unto us, what the treaſure it ſelf within is? The Treaſure it ſelf, is the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> himſelf, and Joy in him. As the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> proceeds from <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son,</hi> but I know not how; ſo there ſhall ſomething proceed from <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and fall upon me, but I know not what. Nay, not fall upon me neither; but enwrap me, embrace me: for, I ſhall not be below them, ſo as that I ſhall not to be upon the ſame ſeat with the <hi>Son,</hi> at the right hand of the <hi>Father,</hi> in the Union of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> Rectified by the Power of the <hi>Father,</hi> and feel no weakneſs; Enlightned by the Wiſdom of the <hi>Son,</hi> and feel no ſcruple; Eſtabliſhed by the Joy of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and feel no jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie.

VVhere I ſhall finde the Virgins, and not be deſpiſed by them, for not being ſo; but hear that Redintegration, which I ſhall receive in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, call'd <hi>Virginity,</hi> and <hi>Intireneſs.</hi> VVhere all tears ſhall be wip'd from mine Eyes; not onely tears of Compunction for my ſelf, and tears of Compaſſion for others; but even tears of Joy, too: for, there ſhall be no ſudden joy, no joy unexperienced there; There I ſhall have all joys, altogether, always. There <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhall not be gladder of his own Salvation, then of mine; nor I ſurer of the Everlaſtingneſs of my God, then of my Everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Him. This is that Treaſure, of which the God of this Treaſure, give us thoſe Spangles; and that ſingle Money, which this Mint can coin, this VVorld can receive, that is, Proſperity, and a good uſe thereof, in worldly things; and Grace, and Peace, and Faith, in ſpiritual. And then reſerve for us the Exaltation of this Treaſure, in the Joy and Glory of Heaven, in the Mediation of his Son Chriſt Jeſus, and by the Operation of his Bleſſed Spirit.</p>

But when this Heretical Emperour had a Victory over this uſurping Tyrant, this unhappy happineſs tranſported him to a greater ſin, a greater inſolence, to approach ſo near to God himſelf, as to call himſelf <hi>Eternum principem,</hi> The eternal Emperour; and to take into his ſtile, and Reſcripts, this additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Eternitatem noſtram,</hi> Thus and thus, it hath pleaſed our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity

it; And as his Decree it ſelf, ſo the wayes and Executions of his Decrees, are often unſearchable, for the purpoſe, and for the reaſon thereof, though for the matter of fact, they may be manifeſt. They that think themſelves ſharp-ſighted and wiſe enough, to ſearch into thoſe unreveal'd Decrees; they who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but worms, will look into Heaven; and being the laſt of Creatures, who were made, will needs enquire, what was done by God, before God did any thing, for creating the World, <hi>In ultimam dementiam reverant,</hi> ſays <hi>S.

            <p>If then it be a preſumpteous thing, and a contempt againſt God, to ſubmit his Decrees to the Examination of humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it muſt be a high treaſon againſt the Majeſty of God, to find out a reaſon in him, which ſhould juſtifie our ſins; To conclude out of any thing which he does, or leaves undone, that either he doth not hate, or cannot puniſh ſinners: For this deſtroys even the Nature of God, and that which the Apoſtle lays, for the foundation of all, <hi>To believe that God is,</hi>

               <note place="margin">Part II.</note>Now the particular reaſon, which the perverſneſs of theſe men produceth here, in this Text, is, <hi>Becauſe God is patient and long-ſuffering.</hi> So he is; ſo he will be ſtill: Their perverſneſs ſhall not pervert his Nature, his goodneſs.

            <p>This then is his patience:<note place="margin">Sententia.</note> But why is his patience made a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their continuance in ſins? Is it becauſe there is no ſentence denounced againſt ſin? Theſe buſie and ſubtile Extractors of Reaſons, that can diſtil, and draw Poyſon out of Manna, Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſin, out of Gods Patience, will not ſay ſo, That there is no ſentence denounced. The word that is here uſed, <hi>Pithgam,</hi> is not truly an Hebrew word: And though in the Book of <hi>Job,</hi> and in ſome other parts of the Hebrew Scriptures, we finde ſometimes ſome forreign and out-landiſh word, deriv'd from other Nations; yet, in <hi>Solomons</hi> writing very rarely; neither doth <hi>Solomon</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor any other Author, of any part of the Hebrew Bible, uſe this word, in any other place, then this one. The word is a <hi>Chaldee</hi> word; and hath amongſt them, the ſame ſignification and largeneſs, as <hi>Dabar</hi> in Hebrew; and that includes all <hi>A verbo ad legem;</hi> from a word ſuddenly and ſlightly ſpoken, to words digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and conſolidated into a Law. So that, though the Septuagint tranſlate this place, <hi>Quia non eſt facta contradictio;</hi> as though the reaſon of this ſinners obduration might have been, That God had not forbidden ſin; and though the Chaldee Paraphraſt expreſs this place thus, <hi>Quia non eſt factum verbum ultionis;</hi> As though this ſinner made himſelf believe, that God had never ſpoken word of revenge againſt ſinners: yet, this ſinner makes not that his reaſon, That there is no Law, no Judgement, no Sentence given: for, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Book of the Bible, every Chapter, every Verſe almoſt, is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> a particular renewing of the Law from Gods mouth, <hi>Morte Morieris, Thou ſhalt die the death;</hi> and of that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence from <hi>Moſes</hi> mouth, <hi>Pereundo peribitis, You ſhall ſurely periſh;</hi> and of that Judgement from the Prophets mouth, <hi>Non eſt Pax im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piis,

There is no peace to the wicked.</hi> And if this obdurate ſinner could be ſuch a <hi>Goth</hi> and <hi>Vandal,</hi> as to deſtroy all Records, all writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Laws; if he could evacuate and exterminate the whole Bible, yet he would finde this Law in his own heart, this Sentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by his own Conſcience, <hi>Stipendium peccati Mors eſt,</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is Death, and ſin is Treaſon.</p>
            <p>His reaſon is not, That there is no Law; he ſees it: nor that he knows no Law; his heart tells it him: nor that he hath kept that Law; his Conſcience gives judgement againſt him: nor that he hath a Pardon for breaking that Law; for he never ask'd it: and, beſides, thoſe Pardons have in them that clauſe, <hi>Ita quod ſe bene gerat;</hi> Every Pardon bindes a man to the good behaviour; and by Relapſes into ſin, we forfeit our Pardons for former ſins.

               <hi>Execution is the life of the Law;</hi> but then, it is the death of the Man: And therefore whoſoever makes quarrels againſt God, or arguments of Obduration, out of this reſpite of Execution, would he be better pleaſed with God, if God came to a ſpeedy Execution? But let that be true, <hi>Where there is no Execution, there is no reverence to the Law;</hi> there is truly, and in effect, no Law: The Law is no more a Law without Execution, then a Carcaſe is a Man.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93368:47"/>
and divided proportionably amongſt his Creditors, <hi>Eo conſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lio tanta immanitas poenae denuatiata est, ne ad eam unquam pervenire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur:</hi> Therefore ſo grievous a puniſhment was inflicted, that that Law might never come to execution: for, from the enacting of that Law, to the laſt times, in that government, there was never any example, of one execution of that Law: ſo we ſhould ſay, That God laid thoſe ſevere penalties upon ſins, onely to deter men from doing them, and not with any purpoſe to inflict thoſe penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. In Laws, to the making whereof, there concurs, beſides the authority of the Prince, the counſel and the conſent of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, there are ſometimes Laws made, without any purpoſe of ordinary execution; of which, the Civil Wiſdom, and the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Conſcience, and the godly Moderation of the Prince, is made a Depoſitory, and a Feoffee in truſt; and thoſe Laws are onely put into his hands, as a Bridle, the better to rule and govern that great Charge committed to him, in emergent neceſſities, though not in an ordinary execution of thoſe penal Laws. But who was a counſellor to God, or who inſerted any Proviſoes or Nonobſtante's into his Laws? or who conditioned them, with any ſuch reſervations, that they ſhould have no ordinary executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? And therefore an ordinary execution they have always had.</p>
            <p>The reaſon why they are ſometimes, and why they are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways executed, <hi>St. Chryſostome</hi> hath aſſign'd; <hi>Si nullus puniretur, nemo exiſtimaret Deum pre-eſſe rebus humanis; ſi omnes, nemo expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret futuram reſurrectionem:</hi> If God ſhould puniſh no ſins here, no man would believe a God; and if God ſhould preſently puniſh all here, no man would be afraid of a future judgement. There the obdurate man may finde a reaſon of the manner of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, in the execution of his judgements: And if he dare ſtand the arguing of this caſe, out of Precedent, out of Record, out of the hiſtory of God, in his Word, he muſt hear heavie judgments denounced, and executed, in caſes, where he would hardly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern any ſin to have been committed, at leaſt, no ſin proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that puniſhment.<note place="margin">Act. 5.</note> If he were in the caſe of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> of having reſerv'd a little of their own, whatſoever ſhould befal, he would never ſee Counſel, nor petition the judge, never apprehend danger in this caſe; and yet, God declared by the mouth of <hi>Peter,</hi> that <hi>Satan had filled their hearts,</hi> and that <hi>they had lyed to the holy Ghost;</hi> and a heavie judgement of preſent death, was executed upon them both. If he had been of the Jury, for that man of God, who,<note place="margin">1 Reg. 13.</note> though God had forbidden him to eat and drink in that place, yet, when an old Prophet came to him, and told him, that God had ſpoken to him by an Angel, that he ſhould go with him, and eat, did go, and eat with him, he would have acquitted him of any offence herein; and yet Gods judgment o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertook

If he ſtudy all this Title, of Gods heavie judgements upon ſins, not great in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance; and then come to them by the conſideration of the nature of the firſt ſin of our firſt parents, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and findes there, ſuch a lightneſs in that ſin of eating forbidden fruit, that he durſt do it, if it were to do again; as though it were no more to diſobey God, when he forbade the eating of fruit, then to diſobey his Phyſician in that point; and yet ſhall ſee the heavie judgement of God upon all poſterity for that ſin, (which he eſteems ſo ſmall a one) to extend ſo far, as that all his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſins, even this very ſin of undervaluing <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, and his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſin of obduration, is but a puniſhment of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin. If he ſhall climb by this ladder, to the higheſt ſtep of all, from <hi>Adam</hi> in paradiſe, to the Angels in heaven, and ſee, that in thoſe Angels, a ſin onely of Omiſſion, of a not turning toward God, (for there was no creature then to turn upon) in ſo pure Natures, and done but once, was ſo heavily puniſhed, as that the bloud of Chriſt Jeſus hath not waſhed it away; certainly the hardneſs, the flinti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this obdurate ſinner, muſt neceſſarily be ſo much mollifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo much entendred, as to confeſs, that he can make no good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument out of that, <hi>That the judgements of God are not executed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Speedily.</note>But yet, howſoever that be, they are not executed <hi>ſpeedily.</hi> How deſperate a ſtate art thou in, if nothing will convert thee, but a ſpeedie execution, after which, there is no poſſibility, no room left for a Converſion? God is <hi>the Lord of hosts,</hi> and he can proceed by Martial Law: he can hang thee upon the next tree; he can choak thee with a crum, with a drop, at a voluptuous feaſt; he can ſink down the Stage and the Player; The bed of wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93368:48"/>
and the wanton actor, into the jaws of the earth, into the mouth of hell: he can ſurpriſe thee, even in the act of ſin; and doſt thou long for ſuch a ſpeedy execution, for ſuch an expedition? Thou canſt not lack Examples, that he hath done ſo upon others, and will no proof ſerve thee, but a ſpeedy judgement upon thy ſelf? Scatter thy thoughts no farther then; contract them in thy ſelf, and conſider Gods ſpeedy execution upon thy ſoul, and upon thy body, and upon thy ſoul and body together. Was not Gods judgement executed ſpeedily enough upon thy ſoul, when in the ſame inſtant that it was created, and conceiv'd, and infus'd, it was put to a neceſſity of contracting Original ſin, and ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the penalty of <hi>Adam</hi>'s diſobedience, the firſt minute? Was not Gods judgement ſpeedily enough executed upon thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, if before it had any temporal life, it had a ſpiritual death; a ſinful conception, before any inanimation? If hereditary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes from thy parents, Gouts and Epilepſies, were in thee, before the diſeaſes of thine own purchaſe, the effects of thy licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and thy riot; and that from the firſt minute that thou beganſt to live, thou beganſt to die too? Are not the judgements of God ſpeedily enough executed upon thy ſoul and body together, every day, when as ſoon as thou commitſt a ſin, thou art preſently left to thine Impenitence, to thine Inſenſibleneſs, and Obduration? Nay, the judgement is more ſpeedy then ſo: for, that very ſin it ſelf, was a puniſhment of thy former ſins.</p>
            <p>But though God may begin ſpeedily, yet he intermits again, he ſlacks his pace; and therefore the execution is not ſpeedy. As it is ſaid of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> often, Becauſe the plagues ceaſed, (though they had been laid upon him) <hi>Ingratum eſt cor Pharaonis, Pharaoh</hi>'s heart was hardned. But firſt we ſee, by that puniſhment which is laid upon <hi>Heli,</hi> That with God it is all one, to begin, and to conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate his judgement: <hi>(When I begin, I will make an end.</hi>

               <hi>Deſpiſest thou the riches of Gods bountifulneſs, and long-ſuffering, not knowing that it leads thee to repentance?</hi> St. <hi>Chryſostome</hi>'s compariſon of ſuch a ſinner to a Vulture, that delights onely in dead carcaſes, that is, in company dead in their ſins, holds beſt, as himſelf notes, in this particular, that the Vulture <hi>perhorreſcit fragrantiam unguenti,</hi> He loaths, and is ill affected with any ſweet ſavour: for ſo doth this ſinner finde death, in that ſoveraign Balm of the patience of God, and he dies of Gods mercy: <hi>Et quid infelicius illis, qui bono odore moriuntur?</hi> ſays S. <hi>Auguſtine:</hi> In what worſe ſtate can any man be, then to take harm of a good air? But, as the ſame Father addes, <hi>Numquid quia mori voluisti, malum fecisti odorem?</hi> This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition in that particular man, does not make this air, an ill air; and yet this abuſe of the patience of God, comes to be an infectious poyſon, and ſuch a poyſon, as ſtrikes the heart; and ſo general, as to ſtrike the heart of <hi>the children of men;</hi> and ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as that their hearts ſhould be <hi>fully ſet in them, to do evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt then, what is this <hi>ſetting of the heart upon evil;</hi> and then, what is this <hi>fulneſs,</hi> that leaves no room for a Cure? When a man receives figures and images of ſin, into his Fancie and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and leads them on to his Underſtanding and Diſcourſe, to his Will, to his Conſent, to his Heart, by a delightful dwelling upon the meditation of that ſin; yet this is not <hi>a ſetting of the heart upon doing evil.</hi> To be ſurpris'd by a Tentation, to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by it, to be held down by it for a time, is not it. It is not when the devil looks in at the window to the heart, by preſenting occaſions of tentations, to the eye; nor when he comes in at the door, to our heart, at the ear, either in laſcivious diſcourſes, or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrical and Libellous defamations of other men: It is not, when the devil is put to his Circuit, to <hi>ſeek whom he may devour,</hi> and how he may corrupt the King by his Council, that is, The Soul by the Senſes: But it is, when by a habitual cuſtom in ſin, the ſin ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes meerly and immediately from my ſelf: It is, when the heart hath uſurp'd upon the devil, and upon the world too, and is able and apt to ſin of it ſelf, if there were no devil, and if there were
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93368:49"/>
no outward objects of tentation: when our own heart is become <hi>ſpontanea inſania, &amp; voluntarius daemon,</hi> Such a wilful Madneſs,<note place="margin">Chryſost.</note> and ſuch a voluntary and natural Devil to it ſelf, as that we ſhould be ambitious, though we were in an Hoſpital; and licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, though we were in a wilderneſs; and voluptuous, though in a famine: ſo that ſuch a mans heart, is as a land of ſuch Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, where the Children are born as great, as the Men of other nations grow to be; for thoſe ſins, which in other men have their birth, and their growth, after their birth, they begin at a Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence, and proceed to a Conſent, and grow up to Actions, and ſwell up to Habits; In this man, ſin begins at a ſtature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion above all this; he begins at a delight in the ſin, and comes inſtantly to a defence of it, and to an obduration and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitibleneſs in it: This is the evil of the heart, by the miſ-uſe of Gods grace, to deveſt and loſe all tenderneſs and remorſe in ſin.</p>
            <p>Now for the Incurableneſs of this heart, it conſiſts firſt in this, that there is a fulneſs; It is <hi>fully ſet to do evil:</hi> &amp; ſuch a full heart hath no room for a Cure; as a full ſtomack hath no room for Phyſick. The Mathematician could have removed the whole world with his Engine, if there had been any place to have ſet his Engine in. Any man might be cur'd of any ſin, if his heart were not full of it, and <hi>fully ſet upon it:</hi> which <hi>ſetting,</hi> is indeed, in a great part, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetledneſs, when the heart is in a perpetual motion, and in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable indifferencie to all ſins: it may be <hi>fully ſet upon</hi> ſin, though it be not vehemently affected to any one ſin. The reaſon which is aſſign'd, why the heart of man, if it receive a wound, is incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, is the palpitation, and the continual motion of the heart: for, if the heart could lie ſtill, ſo that fit things might be applyed to it, and work upon it, all wounds in all parts of the heart, were not neceſſarily mortal: So, if our hearts were not diſtracted, in ſo many forms, and ſo divers ways of ſin, it might the better be cur'd of any one. St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> had this apprehenſion, when he ſaid, <hi>Audeo dicere utile eſſe cadere in aliquod manifeſtum peccatum, ut ſibi diſpliceant:</hi> It is well for him, that is indifferent to all ſins, if he fall into ſome ſuch miſery by ſome one ſin, as brings him to a ſenſe of that, and of the reſt. St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> when he ſays this, ſays he ſpeaks boldly in ſaying ſo, <hi>Audeo dicere:</hi> but we may be ſo much more bold, as to ſay further, That that man had been damn'd, if he had not ſinn'd that ſin: For the heart of the indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſinner bayts at all that ever riſes, at all forms and images of ſin: <hi>when he ſees a thief, he runs with him;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 50.</note> 
               <hi>and with the adulterer he hath his portion:</hi> and as ſoon as it contracts any ſpiritual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, any ſin, it is preſently, not onely in <hi>morbo acuto,</hi> but in <hi>morbo complicato;</hi> in a ſharp diſeaſe, and in a manifold diſeaſe, a diſeaſe multiplied in it ſelf. Therefore it is, as St. <hi>Gregory</hi> notes, that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93368:50"/>
the Prophet propoſes it, as the hardeſt thing of all, for a ſinner to return to his own heart, and to finde out that, after it is ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſcattered upon ſo ſeveral ſins. <hi>Redite prevaricatores ad cor,</hi> ſays the Prophet:<note place="margin">Eſa. 46.</note> and, ſays that Father, <hi>Longe eis mittit, cum ad cor redire compellit:</hi> God knows whither he ſends them, when he ſends them to their own heart: for, ſince it is true which the ſame Father ſaid, <hi>Vix ſancti inveniunt cor ſuum,</hi> The holyeſt man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at all times finde his own heart, (his heart may be bent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Religion, and yet he cannot tell in which Religion; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Preaching, and yet he cannot tell which Preacher; and upon Prayer, and yet he ſhall finde ſtrayings and deviations in his Prayer) much more hardly is the various and vagabond heart of ſuch an indifferent ſinner, to be found by any ſearch. If he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire for his heart, at that Chamber where he remembers it was yeſterday, in laſcivious and luſtful purpoſes, he ſhall hear that it went from thence to ſome riotous Feaſting, from thence to ſome Blaſphemous Gaming, after, to ſome Malicious Conſultation of entangling one, and ſupplanting another; and he ſhall never trace it ſo cloſe, as to drive it home, that is, to the conſideration of it ſelf, and that God that made it; nay, ſcarce to make it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in any one particular ſin. That which St. <hi>Bernard</hi> fear'd in <hi>Eugenius,</hi> when he came to be Pope, and ſo to a diſtraction of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worldly buſineſſes, may much more be fear'd in a diſtraction of many ſins, <hi>Cave ne te trahant, quo non vis;</hi> Take heed leſt theſe ſins carry thee farther, then thou intendeſt: thou intendeſt but Pleaſure, or Profit; but the ſin will carry thee farther: <hi>Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris quo?</hi> ſays that Father; Doſt thou ask whither? <hi>Ad cor durum,</hi> To a ſenſleſneſs, a remorſleſneſs, a hardneſs of heart: <hi>nec pergas quaerere,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>quid illud ſit;</hi> Never ask what that hardneſs of heart is: for, if thou know it not, thou haſt it.</p>
            <p>This then is the <hi>fulneſs,</hi> and ſo the Incurableneſs of the heart, by that reaſon of perpetual motion; becauſe it is in perpetual progreſs from ſin to ſin, he never conſiders his ſtate. But there is another fulneſs intended here, That he is come to a full point, to a conſideration of his ſin, and to a ſtation and ſetledneſs in it, out of a foundation of Reaſon, as though it were, not onely an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, but a wiſe proceeding, <hi>Becauſe Gods judgements are not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</hi> But when man becomes to be thus <hi>fully ſet,</hi> God ſhall ſet him faſter:<note place="margin">Job 14.17.</note>

How far gone is he into a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful eſtate, that neither deſires to be pitied by others, nor pities himſelf, nor diſcerns that his ſtate needs pity? <hi>Invaluerat ira tua ſuper me, &amp; neſciebam,</hi> ſays bleſſed St. <hi>Auguſtine:</hi> Thy hand lay heavie upon me, and I found it not to be thy hand: becauſe the Maledictions of God are honeyed and candied over, with a little cruſt or ſweetneſs of worldly eaſe, or reprieve, we do not apprehend them in their true taſte, and right nature. <hi>Obſurdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eram ſtridore catenarum mearum,</hi> ſays the ſame Father: The jing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ratling of our Chains and Fetters, makes us deaf: The weight of the judgement takes away the ſenſe of the judgement. This is <hi>the full ſetting of the heart to do evil,</hi> when a man fills him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the liberty of paſſing into any ſin, in an indifferencie; and then findes no reaſon why he ſhould leave that way, either by the love, or by the fear of God. If he proſper by his ſin, then he findes <hi>no reaſon;</hi> if he do not proſper by it, yet he findes <hi>a wrong reaſon.</hi> If unſeaſonable flouds drown his Harveſt, and fruſtrate all his labours, and his hopes; he never findes, that his oppreſſing, and grinding of the Poor, was any cauſe of thoſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but he looks onely how the Winde ſate, and how the ground lay; and he concludes, that if <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 14.14.</note> and <hi>Daniel</hi> had been there, their labour muſt have periſhed, and been drown'd, as well as his. If a vehement Fever take hold of him, he remembers where he ſweat, and when he took cold; where he walked too faſt, where his Caſement ſtood open, and where he was too bold upon Fruit, or meat of hard digeſtion; but he never remembers the ſinful and naked Wantonneſſes, the profuſe and waſtful Dilapidations of his own body, that have made him thus obnoxious and open to all dangerous Diſtempers. Thunder from heaven burns his Barns, and he ſays, What luck was this? if it had fallen but ten foot ſhort or over, my barns had been ſafe: whereas his former blaſphemings of the Name of God, drew down that Thunder upon that houſe, as it was his; and that Lightning could no more fall ſhort or over, then the Angel which was ſent to <hi>Sodom,</hi> could have burnt another Citie, and have ſpar'd that; or then the Plagues of <hi>Moſes</hi> and of <hi>Aaron</hi> could have fallen upon <hi>Goſhen,</hi> and have ſpar'd <hi>Egypt.</hi> His Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers abound with Manna, he overflows with all for neceſſities, and with all delicacies, in this life; and yet he findes worms in his Manna, a putrefaction, and a mouldring away, of this abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ſtate; but he ſees not that that is, becauſe his Manna was gathered upon the Sabbath, that there were profanations of the

Name and Ordinances of God, mingled in his means of growing rich. To end all, This is the true Uſe that we are to make of the long-ſuffering and patience of God, That when his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience ends, ours may begin: That if he forbear others rather then us,<note place="margin">21.7.</note> we do not expoſtulate, as in <hi>Job, Wherefore do the wicked live, and become old, and grow mighty in power?</hi> but rather, if he cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe us rather then others,<note place="margin">Pſal. 44.18.</note> ſay with <hi>David, Our heart is not turned back, neither have our ſteps declined from thy ways, though thou haſt ſore broken us, in the place of dragons, and covered us with the ſhadow of death:</hi> And that if <hi>ſentence be executed</hi> upon us, we may make uſe of his judgement; and if not, we may continue, and enlarge his mercies towards us.</p>

               <note place="margin">Part I.</note>Firſt then, We enter into our firſt Part, The ſlipperineſs of habitual ſin, with that note of S. <hi>Gregorie, Peccatum cum voce, eſt culpa cum actione; peccatum cum clamore, eſt culpa cum libertate;</hi> Sinful thougths produc'd into actions, are ſpeaking ſins; ſinful actions continued into habits, are crying ſins. There is a ſin before theſe; a ſpeechleſs ſin, a whiſpering ſin, which no body hears, but our own conſcience; which is, when a ſinful thought or purpoſe is born in our hearts, firſt we rock it, by toſſing, and tumbling it in our fancies, and imaginations, and by entertaining it with delight and conſent, &amp; with remembring, with how much pleaſure we did the like ſin before, and how much we ſhould have, if we could bring this to paſs; And as we rock it, ſo we ſwathe it, we cover it, with ſome pretences, ſome excuſes, ſome hopes of coveraling it; and this is that, which we call <hi>Moroſam delectationem,</hi> a delight to ſtand in the air and proſpect of a ſin, and a loathneſs to let it go out of our ſight. Of this ſin S. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſayes nothing in this place, but onely of actual ſins, which he calls <hi>ſpeaking;</hi> and of habitual, which he calls <hi>crying ſins.</hi> And this is as far, as the Schools, or the Caſuiſts do ordinarily trace ſin; To find out <hi>peccata Infantia,</hi> ſpeechleſs ſins, in the heart; <hi>pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata vocatia,</hi> ſpeaking ſins, in our actions; And <hi>peccata clamantia,</hi> crying and importunate ſins, which will not ſuffer God to take his reſt, no nor to fulfil his own Oath, and proteſtation: He hath ſaid, <hi>As I live, I would not the death of a ſinner;</hi> and they extort a death from him. But beſides theſe, Here is a farther degree, beyond ſpeaking ſins, and crying ſins; beyond actual ſins and habitual ſins; here are <hi>peccata cum ratione,</hi> and <hi>cum diſputatione;</hi> we will reaſon, we will debate, we will diſpute it out with God, and we will conclude againſt all his Arguments, that there is a <hi>Quia,</hi> a Reaſon, why we ſhould proceed and go forward in our ſin: <hi>Et pudet non eſſe impudentes,</hi> as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> heightens this ſinful diſpoſition; Men grow aſham'd of all holy ſhamefac'dneſs, and tenderneſs toward ſin; they grow aſham'd to be put off, or frighted from their ſinful pleaſure, with the ordinary terror of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:93368:52"/>
Gods imaginary judgements; aſham'd to be no wiſer then S. <hi>Paul</hi> would have them, to be mov'd, or taken hold of, <hi>by the fooliſhneſs of preaching;</hi> or to be no ſtronger of themſelves then ſo,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.21.</note> that we ſhould truſt to anothers taking of our infirmities,<note place="margin">Matth. 8.</note> and bearing of our ſickneſſes; Or to be no richer, or no more provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent then ſo, To ſell all, and give it away,<note place="margin">Luc. 12.</note> and make a treaſure in Heaven, and all this for fear of Theeves, and Ruſt, and Canker, and Moths here. That which is not allowable in Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, in criminal Cauſes, To hear Evidence againſt the King, we will admit againſt God; we will hear Evidence againſt God; we will hear what mans reaſon can ſay in favor of the Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, why he ſhould be condemned; why God ſhould puniſh the ſoul eternally, for the momentany pleaſures of the body: Nay, we ſuborn witneſſes againſt God, and we make Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy and Reaſon ſpeak againſt Religion, and againſt God; though indeed, <hi>Omne verum, omni vero conſentiens;</hi> whatſoever is true in Philoſophy, is true in Divinity too; howſoever we diſtort it, and wreſt it to the contrary. We hear Witneſſes, and we ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orn Witneſſes againſt God; and we do more; we proceed by Recriminations, and a croſs Bill, with a <hi>Quia Deus,</hi> becauſe God does as he does, we may do as we do; Becauſe God does not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Sinners, we need not forbear ſins; whilſt we ſin ſtrongly, by oppreſſing others, that are weaker, or craftily by circumventing others that are ſimple. This is but <hi>Leoninum,</hi> and <hi>Vulpinum,</hi> that tincture of the Lyon, and of the Fox, that brutal nature that is in us. But when we come to ſin, upon reaſon, and upon diſcourſe, upon Meditation, and upon plot, This is <hi>Humanum,</hi> to become the Man of Sin, to ſurrender that, which is the Form, and Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of man, Reaſon, and underſtanding, to the ſervice of ſin. When we come to ſin wiſely and learnedly, to ſin logically, by a <hi>Quia,</hi> and an <hi>Ergo,</hi> that, Becauſe God does thus, we may do as we do, we ſhall come to ſin through all the Arts, and all our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, To ſin Grammatically, to tie ſins together in conſtruction, in a Syntaxis, in a chaine, and dependance, and coherence upon one another: And to ſin Hiſtorically, to ſin over ſins of other men again, to ſin by precedent, and to practice that which we had read: And we come to ſin Rhetorically, perſwaſively, powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and as we have found examples for our ſins in Hiſtory, ſo we become examples to others, by our ſins, to lead and encourage them, in theirs; when we come to employ upon ſin, that which is the eſſence of man, Reaſon, and diſcourſe, we will alſo employ upon it, thoſe which are the properties of man onely, which are, To ſpeak, and to laugh; we will come to ſpeak, and talk, and to boaſt of our ſins, and at laſt, to laugh and jeſt at our ſins; and as we have made ſin a Recreation, ſo we will make a jeſt of our condemnation.

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Part II.</note>Now amongſt the manifold perverſneſſes and incongruities of this artificial ſinning, of ſinning upon Reaſon, upon a <hi>quia,</hi> and an <hi>ergo,</hi> of arguing a cauſe for our ſin; this is one, That we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver aſſigne the right cauſe: we impute our ſin to our Youth, to our Conſtitution, to our Complexion; and ſo we make our ſin our Nature: we impute it to our Station, to our Calling, to our Courſe of life; and ſo we make our ſin our Occupation: we impute it to Neceſſity, to Perplexity, that we muſt neceſſarily do that, or a worſe ſin; and ſo we make our ſin our Direction. We ſee the whole world is <hi>Eccleſia malignantium,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 26.5.</note> a Synagogue, a Church of wicked men; and we think it a Schiſmatical thing, to ſeparate our ſelves from that Church, and we are loth to be excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in that Church; and ſo we apply our ſelves to that, we do as they do, with the wicked we are wicked; and ſo we make our ſin our Civility. And though it be ſome degree of injuſtice, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute all our particular ſins, to the devil himſelf, after a habit of ſin hath made us <hi>ſpontaneos daemones,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chryſost.</note> devils to our ſelves; yet we do come too near an imputing our ſins to God himſelf, when we place ſuch an impoſſibility in his Commandments, as makes us lazie, that becauſe we cannot do all, therefore we will do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; or ſuch a manifeſtation and infallibility in his Decree, as makes us either ſecure, or deſperate; and ſay, The Decree hath ſav'd me, therefore I can take no harm; or, The Decree hath damn'd me, therefore I can do no good. No man can aſſigne a reaſon in the Sun, why his body caſts a ſhadow: why all the place round about him, is illumin'd by the Sun, the reaſon is in the Sun; but of his ſhadow, there is no other reaſon, but the groſneſs of his own body: why there is any beam of light, any ſpark of life, in my ſoul, he that is the Lord of light and life, and would not have me die in darkneſs, is the onely cauſe; but of the ſhadow of death, wherein I ſit, there is no cauſe, but mine own corruption. And this is the cauſe, why I do ſin; but why I ſhould ſin, there is none at all.</p>
            <p>Yet in this Text the Sinner aſſignes a cauſe; and it is, <hi>Quia non mutationes,</hi> Becauſe they have no Changes. God hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that earth, which he hath given to the ſons of men, to reſt, and ſtand ſtill; and that heaven which he reſerves for thoſe ſons of men, who are alſo the ſons of God, he hath appointed to ſtand ſtill too: All that is between heaven and earth, is in perpetual motion, and viciſſitude; but all that is appointed for man, mans poſſeſſion here, mans reverſion hereafter, earth and heaven, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for reſt, and ſtands ſtill; and therefore God proceeds in his own way, and declares his love moſt, where there are feweſt Changes. This reſt of heaven, he hath expreſſed often, by the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93368:53"/>
name of a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> as in that Petition, <hi>Thy kingdom come:</hi> And that reſt which is to be derived upon us, here in earth, he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the ſame phraſe too, when having preſented to the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> an Inventary and Catalogue of all his former bleſſings, he concludes all, includes all in this one, <hi>Et proſperata es in regnum,</hi> I have advanced thee to be a kingdom: which form, God hath not onely ſtill preſerv'd to us, but hath alſo united Kingdoms to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and to give us a ſtronger body, and ſafer from all Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, whereas he hath made up other Kingdoms, of Towns and Cities, he hath made us a Kingdom of Kingdoms, and given us as many Kingdoms to our Kingdom, as he hath done Cities to ſome other. Gods gracious purpoſe then to man, being Reſt, and a contented Repoſedneſs in the works of their ſeveral Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; and his purpoſe being declared upon us, in the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and preſerving of ſuch a Kingdom, as hath the beſt Body, (beſt united in it ſelf, and knit together) and the beſt Legs to ſtand upon, (Peace and Plenty) and the beſt Soul to inanimate and direct it, (Truth of Religion) and the beſt Spirits to make all parts anſwerable and uſeful to one another, (Wiſdom and Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancie in the Prince, Gratitude and Chearfulneſs in the Subject:) And ſince God hath gone ſo far, once in our time already, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing his care of our Reſt and Quiet, as to give us a Change without Change, an alteration of Perſons, and not of Things, that we ſaw old things done away, in the Seceſſion of one, and all things made new in the Succeſſion of another Soveraign, and all this newneſs done without Innovation; ſo that,<note place="margin">Pſal. 76.9.</note> as <hi>David</hi> ſays of the whole earth, we might ſay again of this Land, <hi>Terra tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muit &amp; quievit,</hi> The earth ſhak'd, and ſtood ſtill at once; it was all one act, to have been afraid, and to have been inſtantly ſecur'd again, ſince nothing beyond that, nothing equal to that Change, can be imagin'd by us from God; may it be ever his gracious pleaſure, to continue to us, the enjoying of our preſent Reſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhewing us any more Changes. As (to end this Branch) it were a ſtrange enormity, a ſtrange perverſneſs in any man, to plant a Garden in any place, therefore, becauſe he foreſaw an Earthquake in that place, that would diſorder and diſcompoſe his Garden again; or to build in any place therefore, becauſe the fire were likelieſt to take hold of that ſtreet; that is, to make any thing the cauſe of an action, which ſhould naturally enforce the contrary: ſo is it an irreligious diſtemper, to be the bolder in ſin, becauſe <hi>we have no Changes,</hi> or to defer our converſion from ſin, till Changes, till Afflictions come. For, Satan knew the air, and complexion, and diſpoſition of the world, well enough: he argued not impertinently, nor frivolouſly, for the general, though he were deceived in the particular, in <hi>Job,</hi> when he ſaid to God,<note place="margin">2.5.</note> 
               <hi>Stretch out thy hand, and touch his bones, and his fleſh, and ſee if he will
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:93368:54"/>
not blaſpheme thee to thy face.</hi> Afflictions, and Changes in this life, do not always direct us upon God: The diſpleaſure of a Prince may make a harſh perſon more ſupple, more appliable then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; his graces receiv'd may make him more acceſſible, more equal, more obſequious, then before: and loſſes and forfeitures ſuſtain'd, or threatned, may make him more apt to give, to bleed out, to redeem his dangers, then before: But theſe Changes do not always make him an honeſter man, nor a better Chriſtian then before.<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 4.11.</note> And therefore, ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Study to be quiet;</hi> Labour to finde a teſtimony of Gods love to you, in your preſent eſtate, and never put your ſelf, either for temporal, or ſpiritual amendment, upon Changes.</p>
            <p>To proceed then: This ſhutting up of themſelves againſt the fear of God, is not meerly <hi>quia non mutationes,</hi> becauſe there are no changes; but, <hi>quia non illis,</hi> becauſe <hi>They</hi> have no changes. It is a dangerous preterition, not to bring a mans ſelf into Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; but to conſider no man but himſelf, to make himſelf the meaſure of all, is as dangerous a narrowneſs. The Epigramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt deſcribes the Atheiſt ſo, That he deſires no better argument to prove that there is no God, but that he ſees himſelf, <hi>Dum negat ista beatum,</hi> proſper well enough, though he do not believe this proſperity to proceed from God. What miſeries ſoever fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others, affect not him. He may have ſeen, ſince he was born, the greateſt Kingdom in Chriſtendom likely to have been broken in pieces, and canton'd into petty Seigniories, and ſo left no King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: he may have ſeen ſuch a danger upon our next neighbours, as that, when the powerfulleſt Enemy in Chriſtendom hung over their heads, and lay upon their backs, they bred a more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enemy in their own boſomes, and bowels, by tearing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in pieces, with Differences, in Points of ſubdivided Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and impertinent Scruples, unjuſtly call'd Points of Religion; in which, men leave Peace, and Unity, and Charity, the true ways of Salvation, and will enquire nothing, but how ſoon, how early God damn'd them: They muſt know, <hi>ſub quibus Conſulibus,</hi> in whoſe Reign, in whoſe Mayoralty, what hour of the day, and what minute of that hour, Gods eternal Decree of Election or Reprobation was made. Many, very many of theſe Changes he may have ſeen and heard; but all theſe he hears, as though he heard them out of <hi>Livie,</hi> or out of <hi>Beroſus,</hi> or in Letters from <hi>China,</hi> or <hi>Japan;</hi> and not as though they concern'd his Time, or his Place, or his Obſervation. To contract this: We have all been either in Wars, and ſeen men fall at our right hand, and at our left, by the Bullet; or at Sea, and ſeen our Conſort ſunk by Tempeſt, or taken by Pyrates; or in the Citie, and ſeen the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence devour our Parents above us, our Children below us, our Friends round about us; or in the Court, and ſeen Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:93368:54"/>
overtake the moſt ſecure, and confident: we have all ſeen ſuch Changes as theſe everywhere; but <hi>quia non nobis,</hi> becauſe the Bullet, the Shipwrack, the Pyrate, the Peſtilence, the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have not reach'd us, in our particular perſons, they have not imprinted the fear of God in us.</p>
            <p>And the word of the Text, carries it farther then ſo:<note place="margin">Non habent.</note> it is not becauſe <hi>There are no Changes,</hi> for they abound; nor becauſe <hi>They have had none,</hi> for none eſcapes; but it is, <hi>Qui a non habent,</hi> becauſe they have no preſent, nor imminent danger in their contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion now; becauſe no affliction lies upon them now, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are ſecure. It is not <hi>Quia non habuerunt;</hi> every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, every State, every Church, hath had Changes: Becauſe the Romane Church will needs be all the world, we may conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all the world in her, ſo far; ſhe hath had ſuch a Change, as hath awakened other Princes to re-aſſume, and to reſtore to themſelves, and their Crowns, their juſt Dignities; ſo ſhe hath had a Change in Honour and Eſtimation. She hath had ſuch a Change, as hath contracted and brought her into a narrower cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and call'd in her overflowings; ſo ſhe hath had a Change in Power and Juriſdiction. She hath had ſuch a Change, as hath leſſened her Temporal treaſure everywhere, and utterly aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her imaginary Spiritual treaſure, in many places; ſhe hath had a change in Means, and Profit, and Revenue: ſhe hath had ſuch a change, as that they who by Gods commandment are <hi>come out from her,</hi> have been equal, even in number, to them who have adhered to her; ſuch a change, as hath made her Doctrine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, ſome to be <hi>the doctrines of men,</hi> and ſome <hi>the doctrines of devils:</hi> ſuch a change in Reputation, in Juriſdiction, and in Revenue, and in Power, and in manifeſtation of her Diſguiſes, ſhe hath had: But <hi>quia non habet,</hi> becauſe ſhe decays not every day, the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeems to her to be come to a period, as high as it ſhall go: Becauſe ſhe hath a miſ-apprehenſion of ſome faintneſs, ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinableneſs towards her again, even in ſome of our Profeſſors themſelves, who (as ſhe thinks) come as near to her, as they dare: Becauſe ſhe hath gained of late upon many of the weaker ſex, <hi>women laden with ſin;</hi> and of weaker fortunes, men laden with debts; and of weaker conſciences, ſouls laden with ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; therefore ſhe imagines that ſhe hath ſeen the worſt, and is at an end of her change; though this be but indeed a running, an ebbing back of the main River, but onely a giddy and circular Eddy, in ſome ſhallow places of the ſtream, (which ſtream, God be bleſſed, runs on ſtill currantly, and conſtantly, and purely, and intemerately, as before) yet becauſe her corrections are not multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, becauſe her abſolute Ruine is not accelerated, ſhe hath ſome falſe conceptions of a general returning towards her, and ſhe fears up her ſelf againſt all ſenſe of Truth, and all tenderneſs of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:93368:55"/>
Peace; and becauſe ſhe hath rid out one ſtorm, in <hi>Luther</hi> and his ſucceſſors, therefore ſhe <hi>fears not the Lord</hi> for any other, <hi>Quia non habent, Becauſe ſhe hath no changes,</hi> now.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Habuerunt</hi> then, They have had changes; and <hi>Habebunt,</hi> They ſhall have more, and greater: <hi>Impii non ſtabunt,</hi> ſays <hi>David,</hi> The wicked ſhall not ſtand: In how low ground ſoever they ſtand, and in how great torment ſoever they ſtand, yet they ſhall not ſtand there, but ſink to worſe; and at laſt, <hi>non ſtabunt in judicio,</hi> They ſhall not ſtand in judgement, but fall there, from whence there is no riſing: <hi>Non ſtabunt:</hi> They ſhall not ſtand, though they think they ſhall; they ſhall counterfeit the Seals of the Holy Ghoſt, and delude themſelves with imaginary certitudes of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and illuſory apprehenſions of Decrees of Election: nay, <hi>non ſtabunt,</hi> They ſhall not be able to think that they ſhall ſtand: that which the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.12.</note> 
               <hi>Let him that thinketh he ſtandeth, take heed lest he fall,</hi> belongs onely to the godly; onely they can think, deliberately, and upon juſt examination of the marks and eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Elect, that they ſhall ſtand: God ſhall ſuffer the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to ſink down, not to a godly ſenſe of their infirmity, and holy remorſe of the effects thereof; but yet lower then that, to a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident jealouſie, to a deſperate acknowledgement, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand in the ſight of God: they ſhall have no true reſt at laſt: they ſhall not ſtand; nay, they ſhall not have that half, that falſe comfort by the way; they ſhall not be able to flatter themſelves by the way, with that imagination that they ſhall ſtand.</p>
            <p>Now, both the ungodly, and godly too, muſt have Changes: in matter of Fortune, changes are common to them both: and then, in all, of all conditions, <hi>Mortalitas Mutabilitas,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine:</hi> even this, That we muſt die, is a continual change. The very ſame word,<note place="margin">14.14.</note> which is here, <hi>kalaph,</hi> is in <hi>Job</hi> alſo: <hi>All the days of my appointed time, till my changing come.</hi> And becauſe this word which we tranſlate <hi>changing,</hi> is there ſpoken in the perſon of a righteous man,<note place="margin">Symma.</note> ſome Tranſlators have rendred that place, <hi>Donec veniat ſancta nativitas mea,</hi> Till I be born again: the change, the death of ſuch men, is a better birth: And ſo the Chaldee Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſts, the firſt Expoſition of the Bible, have expreſs'd it, <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſque rurſus fiam,</hi> Till I be made up again by death: He does not ſtay to call the Reſurrection a making up; but this death, this diſſolution, this change, is a new creation; this Divorce is a new Marriage; this very Parting of the ſoul, is an Infuſion of a ſoul, and a Tranſmigration thereof out of my boſome, into the boſom of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bernard.</note> But yet, though it is all this, yet it is a change; <hi>Maxima mutatio est Mutabilitatis in Immutabilitatem,</hi> To be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſo, as that we can never be changed more, is the greateſt change of all. All muſt be changed ſo far, as to die: yea, thoſe who ſhall, in ſome ſort, eſcape that death; thoſe whom the laſt
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93368:55"/>
day ſhall ſurpriſe upon earth, though <hi>they ſhall not die,</hi> yet <hi>they ſhall be changed. Statutum est omnibus, ſemel mori,</hi> All men muſt die once;<note place="margin">Heb. 9.27.</note> we live all under that Law. But <hi>ſtatutum nemini hic mori:</hi> ſince the promiſe of a Meſſiah, there is no Law, no Decree, by which any man muſt neceſſarily die twice; a Temporal death, and a Spiritual death too. It is not the Man, but the Sinner, that dies the ſecond death: God ſees ſin in that man, or elſe that man had never ſeen the ſecond death. So we ſhall all have one change, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe which we have all had; good and bad muſt die: but the men in this text, ſhall have two. But whatſoever changes are upon others in the world, whatſoever upon themſelvs; whatſoever they have had, whatſoever they are ſure to have; yet, <hi>Quia non habent, non timent Deum;</hi> Becauſe they have none now, they fear not God. And ſo we are come to our third and laſt Part.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They fear not God:</hi> This is ſuch a ſtate,<note place="margin">Part III. <hi>Non timent.</hi>
               </note> as if a man who had been a Schoolmaſter all his life, and taught others to read, or had been a Critick all his life, and <hi>ingenioſus in alienis,</hi> over-witty in other mens Writings, had read an Author better, then that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor meant, and ſhould come to have uſe of his Reading to ſave his life at the Bar, when he had his Book, for ſome petty Felony, and then ſhould be ſtricken with the ſpirit of ſtupidity, and not be able to read then. Such is the ſtate of the wiſeſt, of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedeſt, of the mightieſt in this world: If they fear not God, they have forgot their firſt letters; they have forgot the baſis and foundation of all Power, the reaſon and the purpoſe of all Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the life and the ſoul of all Counſel and Wiſdom: for, <hi>The fear of God is the beginning of all.</hi> They are all fallen into the danger of the Law; they have all ſinn'd: they are offer'd their Book, the merciful promiſes of God to repentant ſinners, in his Word; and they cannot read, they cannot apply them, to their comfort: There is Scripture, but not tranſlated, not transferr'd to them: there is Goſpel, but not preached to them; there are Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, but not ſuperſcribed to them.</p>
            <p>It is an hereditary Sentence,<note place="margin">Pſal. 111.10. Prov. 1.7. Ecclus 1.16.</note> and hath paſs'd from <hi>David</hi> in his Pſalms, to <hi>Solomon</hi> in his Proverbs, and then to him that glean'd after them both, the Author of <hi>Eccleſiasticus, The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wiſdom.</hi> All three profeſs all that, and more then that. It is Bleſſedneſs it ſelf, ſays the father, <hi>David;</hi> Bleſſedneſs it ſelf, ſays the ſon, <hi>Solomon;</hi> and <hi>Plenitudo Sapientiae,</hi> and <hi>Omnis Sapientia,</hi> ſays the other, The fulneſs of wiſdom, and the onely wiſdom. <hi>Job</hi> had ſaid it before them all, <hi>Ecce, timor Domini,</hi>
               <note place="margin">28.</note> 
               <hi>ipſa est ſapientia;</hi> The fear of the Lord, is wiſdom it ſelf: And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Eſai</hi> ſaid it after, of <hi>Ezechias,</hi>
               <note place="margin">33.6.</note> 
               <hi>There ſhall be ſtability of thy times, ſtrength, ſalvation, wiſdom, and knowledge; for, the fear of the Lord ſhall be thy treaſure.</hi> It is our ſupply, if we ſhould fear want, and it is our reaſon that we cannot fear want; for, he that fears
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93368:56"/>
God, fears nothing elſe. As therefore the Holy Ghoſt hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the <hi>beginning of wiſdom</hi> in <hi>this fear;</hi> ſo hath he the conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and perfection of this wiſdom, even in the perfect pattern of all wiſdom,<note place="margin">Eſai. 11.3.</note> in the perſon of Chriſt himſelf, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord ſhall rest upon thee, the ſpirit of wiſdom and underſtanding, the ſpirit of counſel and of might, the ſpirit of knowledge and of the fear of God.</hi> For, without this fear, there is no courage, no confidence, no aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance: And therefore Chriſt begun his Paſſion with a fear, in his Agony, <hi>Triſtis anima,</hi> My ſoul his heavie; but that fear deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him over to a preſent conformity to the will of God, in his <hi>Veruntamen, Yet not my will, but thine be done:</hi> And he ended his Paſſion with a fear, <hi>Eli, Eli, My God, my God, why hast thou forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me?</hi> and that fear deliver'd him over to a preſent aſſurance, <hi>In manus tuas Domine,</hi> confidently to commend his ſpirit into his hands, whom he ſeem'd to be afraid of.</p>
            <p>Since then the Holy Ghoſt, whoſe name is <hi>Love;</hi> ſince God, who <hi>is Love</hi> it ſelf, diſpoſes us to this fear, we may ſee in that, That neither God himſelf, nor thoſe of whom God ſaid, <hi>Ye are gods,</hi> that is, all thoſe who have Authority over others, can be lov'd ſo as they ſhould, except they be fear'd, ſo as they ſhould be too: If you take away due Fear, you take away true Love. Even that fear of God, which we uſe to call <hi>ſervile fear,</hi> which is but an apprehenſion of puniſhment, and is not the nobleſt, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteſt kinde of fear, yet it is a fear, which our Saviour counſels us to entertain;<note place="margin">Matth. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Fear him that can cast ſoul and body into hell;</hi> even that fear, is ſome beginning of wiſdom. That fear <hi>Job</hi> had uſe of, when he ſaid,<note place="margin">31.</note> 
               <hi>Quid faciam cum ſurrexerit ad judicandum Deus?</hi> Here I may lay hold upon means of Reſtitution; but when the Lord ſhall raiſe himſelf to judgement, how ſhall I ſtand? So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo had <hi>David</hi> uſe of this fear,<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.</note> 
               <hi>A judiciis tuis timui:</hi> However I was ever confident in thy mercy, yet I was in fear of thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is that fear which St. <hi>Baſil</hi> directs us to, upon thoſe words,<note place="margin">Pſal. 33.</note> 
               <hi>Timorem Domini docebo vos,</hi> I will teach you the fear of the Lord, <hi>Cogita profundum barathrum,</hi> To learn to fear God, he ſends us to the meditation of the torments of hell. And ſo it is that fear, which wrought that effect in St. <hi>Hierome: Ego ob Gehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae metum carcere iſto me damnavi;</hi> For fear of that execution, I have ſhut my ſelf up in this priſon; for fear of periſhing in the next world, I baniſh my ſelf from this: There is a beginning, there is a great degree of wiſdom, even in this fear.</p>
            <p>Now, as the fear of Gods puniſhments diſpoſes us to love him, ſo that fear which the Magiſtrate imprints, by the execution of his Laws, eſtabliſhes that love which preſerves him, from all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimation and irreverence: for, whom the Enemy does not fear, the Subject does not love. As no Peace is ſafe enough, where there is no thought of War; ſo the love of man towards God, and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93368:56"/>
thoſe who repreſent him, is not permanently ſetled, if there be not a reverential fear, a due conſideration of greatneſs, a diſtance, a diſtinction, a reſpect of Rank, and Order, and Majeſtie. If there be not a little fear, by Juſtice at home, and by power and ſtrength abroad, mingled in it, it is not that love, which God requires, to be firſt directed upon himſelf; and then reflected upon his Stewards and Vice-gerents: for, as every Society is not Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſo every Familiarity is not Love.</p>
            <p>But, to conclude: As he will be fear'd, ſo he will be fear'd, no otherwiſe, then as he is God: <hi>Non timuerunt Deum,</hi> is the increpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Text, <hi>They feared not God.</hi> It is <hi>timor Dei,</hi> and not <hi>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor Jehovae:</hi> God is not here expreſſed by the name of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> that unexpreſſible and unutterable, that incomprehenſible and unimaginable name of Jehovah. God calls not upon us, to be conſider'd as God in himſelf, but as God towards us; not as he is in heaven, but as he works upon earth: And here, not in the School, but in the Pulpit; not in Diſputation, but in Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is not <hi>timor Jehovae,</hi> nor it is not <hi>timor Adonai:</hi> God does not call himſelf in this place, <hi>The Lord:</hi> for, to be Lord, to be proprietary of all, this is <hi>potestas tam utendi quam abutendi,</hi> It gives the Lord of that thing power, to do, abſolutely, what he will with that which is his: And ſo, God, as abſolute Lord, may damn without reſpect of ſin, if he will; and ſave without reſpect of faith, if he will. But God is pleaſed to proceed with us, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that Contract which he hath made with us, and that Law which he hath given to us, in thoſe two Tables, <hi>Tantummodo crede, Onely believe, and thy faith ſhall ſave thee;</hi> and, <hi>Fac hoc &amp; vives, Live well, and thy good works ſhall make ſure thy ſalvation.</hi> Laſtly, God does not call himſelf here <hi>Dominum exercituum, The Lord of hoſts;</hi> God would not onely be conſider'd, and ſerv'd by us, when he afflicts us with any of his ſwords, Famine, War, Peſtilence, Malice, or the like; but the fear requir'd here, is to fear him as God, and as God preſented in this name, <hi>Elohim;</hi> which, though it be a name primarily rooted in power and ſtrength, (for <hi>El</hi> is <hi>Deus fortis,</hi> The powerful God; and as there is no love without fear, ſo there is no fear without power) yet properly it ſignifies his Judgment, and Order, and Providence, and Diſpenſation, and Government of his creatures. It is that name, which goes thorow all Gods whole work of the Creation, and diſpoſition of all creatures, in the firſt of <hi>Geneſis:</hi> in all that, he is call'd by no other name then this, the name <hi>God;</hi> not by <hi>Jehovah,</hi> to preſent an infinite Majeſtie; nor by <hi>Adonai,</hi> to preſent an abſolute power; nor by <hi>Tzebaoth,</hi> to preſent a Force, or Conqueſt: but onely in the name of <hi>God,</hi> his name of Government. All ends in this; To fear God, is to adhere to him, in his way, as he hath diſpenſed and notified himſelf to us; that is, as God is manifeſted in Chriſt,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:93368:57"/>
in the Scriptures, and applied to us out of thoſe Scriptures, by the Church: not to reſt in Nature without God, nor in God without Chriſt, nor in Chriſt without the Scriptures, nor in our private interpretation of Scripture, without the Church. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God fill us with theſe fears, theſe reverences; that we may reverence him, who ſhall at laſt bring us, where there ſhall be no more changes; and hath already plac'd us in ſuch a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as being to us a Type and Repreſentation of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven, we humbly beg, may evermore continue with us, without changes, in Government, or in Religion.</p>

S. <hi>Mark,</hi> and none but S. <hi>Mark</hi> records, that ſtory,<note place="margin">7.31.</note> of Chriſts recovering a dumb man, and almoſt deaf, of both infirmities: In which, when we ſee, that our Saviour Chriſt, though he could have recover'd that man with a word, with a touch, with a thought, yet was pleas'd to enlarge himſelf in all thoſe ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial circumſtances, of impoſition of hands, of piercing his ears

with his fingers, of wetting his tongue with ſpittle, and ſome others, we might thereby be inſtructed, not to under-value ſuch ceremonies as have been inſtituted in the Church, for the awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of mens conſideration, and the exalting of their devotion; though thoſe ceremonies, primarily, naturally, originally, funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, and meerly in themſelves, be not abſolutely and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially neceſſary: And this we have from that which is recorded by S. <hi>Mark,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2.42.</note> and none but him. S. <hi>Luke,</hi> and none but S. <hi>Luke,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords the hiſtory of <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s loſing of Chriſt: in which we ſee, how good and holy perſons may loſe Chriſt; and how long? They had loſt him, and were a whole day without miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him: A man may be without Chriſt, and his Spirit, and lie long in an ignorance and ſenſleſneſs of that loſs: And then, where did they loſe him? Even in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in the holy City: even in this holy place, and now in this holy exerciſe, you loſe Chriſt, if either any other reſpect then his glory, brought you hither; or your mindes ſtray out of theſe walls, now you are here. But when <hi>they ſought him,</hi> and <hi>ſought him ſorrowing,</hi> and <hi>ſought him in the Temple,</hi> then <hi>they found him:</hi> If in a holy ſadneſs and penitence, you ſeek him here, in his Houſe, in his Ordinance, here he is always at home, here you may always finde him. And this we have out of that which S. <hi>Luke</hi> reports, and none but he. S. <hi>John,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2.11.</note> and none but S. <hi>John,</hi> records the ſtory of Chriſts mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous changing of water into wine, at the marriage in <hi>Cana:</hi> In which, we ſee, both that Chriſt honour'd the ſtate of Marriage, with his perſonal preſence, and alſo that he afforded his ſervants ſo plentiful a uſe of his creatures, as that he was pleaſed to come to a miraculous ſupply of wine, rather then they ſhould want it. Some things are ſeverally recorded by the ſeveral Evangeliſts, as all theſe; and then ſome things are recorded by all four; as <hi>John Baptist</hi>'s humility, and lowe valuation of himſelf, in reſpect of Chriſt; which he expreſſes in that phraſe, <hi>That he was not worthy to carry his ſhooes.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt had a care, that this ſhould be repeated to us by all four, That the beſt endeavours of Gods beſt ſervants, are unprofitable, unavailable in themſelves, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then as Gods gracious acceptation inanimates them, and as he puts his hand to that plough which they drive or draw. Now our Text hath neither this ſingularity, nor this univerſality; it is neither in one onely, nor in all the Evangeliſts: but it hath (as they ſpeak in the Law) an interpretative univerſality, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive univerſality: for that which hath a plurality of voices, is ſaid to have all; and this Text hath ſo; for three of the four Evangeliſts have recorded this Text: onely S. <hi>John,</hi> who doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially extend himſelf about the divine nature of Chriſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termits it; but all the reſt, who inſiſt more upon his aſſuming our nature, and working our ſalvation in that, the Holy Ghoſt
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93368:58"/>
hath recorded, and repeated this proteſtation of our Saviour's, <hi>I came to call not the righteous, but ſinners to repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which words, being ſpoken by Chriſt,<note place="margin">Diviſio.</note> upon occaſion of the Phariſees murmuring at his admitting of Publicans and ſinners to the Table with him, at that feaſt which S. <hi>Matthew</hi> made him, at his houſe, ſoon after his calling to the Apoſtleſhip, direct our conſideration upon the whole ſtory, and do, not afford but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, not admit but invite this Diſtribution; That, firſt, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the occaſion of the words, and then the words themſelves: for of theſe twins is this Text pregnant, and quick, and eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd. In the firſt, we ſhall ſee the pertinencie of Chriſts an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; and in the ſecond, the doctrine thereof: In the firſt, how fit it was for them; in the other, how neceſſary for us: Firſt, the Hiſtorical part, which was occaſional; and then the Catechiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal part, which is doctrinal. And in the firſt of theſe, the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical and Occaſional part, we ſhall ſee, firſt, That Chriſt by his perſonal preſence juſtified Feaſting, ſomewhat more then was meerly neceſſary, for ſociety, and chearful converſation: He ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified feaſting, and feaſting in an Apoſtles houſe: though a Church-man, and an Exemplar-man, he was not depriv'd of a plentiful uſe of Gods creatures, nor of the chearfulneſs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. And then he juſtified feaſting in the company of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and ſinners; intimating therein, that we muſt not be in things of ordinary converſation, over-curious, over-inquiſitive of other mens manners: for whatſoever their manners be, a good man need not take harm by them, and he may do good amongſt them. And then laſtly, we ſhall ſee the calumny that the Phariſees caſt upon Chriſt for this, and the iniquity of that calumny, both in the manner, and in the matter thereof. And in theſe Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches we ſhall determine that firſt, The Hiſtorical, the Occaſional part: And in the ſecond, The Catechiſtical and Doctrinal, <hi>(I came to call not the righteous, but ſinners to repentance)</hi> we ſhall paſs by theſe ſteps: firſt, we ſhall ſee the Actions; <hi>venit,</hi> he came; that is, firſt, <hi>venit actu:</hi> whereas he came by promiſe, even in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe; and by frequent ratification, in all the Prophets; now he is really, actually come; <hi>venit,</hi> he is come, we look for no other after him; we joyn no other, Angels nor Saints, with him: <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit,</hi> he is actually come; and then, <hi>venit ſponte,</hi> he is come free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and of his good-will; we aſſigne, we imagine no cauſe in us, that ſhould invite him to come, but humbly acknowledge all to have proceeded from his own goodneſs: and that's the Action, <hi>He came.</hi> And then the Errand, and purpoſe for which he came, is <hi>vocare,</hi> he came <hi>to call:</hi> It is not, <hi>Occurrere,</hi> That he came to meet them, who were upon the way before; for no man had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſpoſition in himſelf, or faculty in himſelf, neither will nor
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:93368:59"/>
power to riſe and meet him, no nor ſo much as to wiſh that Chriſt would call him, till he did call him: He came not <hi>occurrere,</hi> to meet us; but yet he came not <hi>cogere,</hi> to compel us, to force us, but onely <hi>vocare,</hi> to call us, by his Word, and Sacraments, and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and lead us ſo; and that's his errand, and purpoſe in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And from that, we ſhall come to the perſons upon whom his coming works: where we have firſt a Negative, a fearful thing in Chriſts lips; and then an Affirmative, a bleſſed ſeal in his mouth: firſt, an Excluſive, a fearful baniſhment out of his Ark; and then an Incluſive, a bleſſed naturalization in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: <hi>Non justos, I came to call, not the righteous, but ſinners.</hi> And then laſtly, we have, not as before, his general intention and purpoſe, To call; but the particular effect &amp; operation of this calling upon the godly, it brings them <hi>to repentance.</hi> Chriſt does not call us to a ſatisfaction of Gods juſtice, by our ſelves; that's impoſſible to us: it is not <hi>ad ſatisfactionem;</hi> but then it is not <hi>adgloriam,</hi> he does not call us to an immediate poſſeſſion of glory, without doing any thing before; but it is <hi>ad Reſipiſcentiam; I came to call, not the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, but ſinners, to Repentance.</hi> And ſo have you the whole frame mark'd out, which we ſhall ſet up; and the whole compaſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd, which we ſhall walk in: In which, though the pieces may ſeem many, yet they do ſo naturally flow out of one another, that they may eaſily enter into your underſtanding; and ſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally depend upon one another, that they may eaſily lay hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your memory.</p>

               <note place="margin">Part I. <hi>Ambroſe.</hi>
               </note>Firſt then, our firſt Branch in the firſt Part, is, That Chriſt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Feaſting, feſtival and chearful converſation. For, as S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> ſays, <hi>Fruſtra feciſſet;</hi> God, who made the world primarily for his own glory, had made Light in vain, if he had made no creatures to ſee, and to be ſeen by that light, wherein he might receive glory: ſo, <hi>fruſtra feciſſet,</hi> God, who intended ſecondarily mans good in the Creation, had made creatures to no purpoſe, if he had not allow'd Man a uſe, and an enjoying of thoſe creatures. Our Mythologiſts, who think they have conveyed a great deal of Moral doctrine in their Poetical Fables, (and ſo, indeed they have) had miſtaken the matter much, when they make it one of the torments of hell, to ſtand in a freſh River, and not be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to drink; and amongſt pleaſant fruits, and not to be ſuffered to eat; if God requir'd ſuch a forbearing, ſuch an abſtemiouſneſs in Man, as that being ſet to rule and govern the creatures, he might not uſe and enjoy them: Priviledges are loſt, by abuſing; but ſo they are, by not uſing too. Of thoſe three Opinions, which have all paſs'd through good Authors, Whether, before the Floud had impaired and corrupted the herbs and fruits of the earth, men did eat fleſh or no; of which, the firſt is abſolutely Negative, both in matter of law, and in matter of fact, No man might, no
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93368:59"/>
man did; and the ſecond is directly contrary to this, Affirmative in both, All men might, all men did; and the third goes a Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle way, It was always lawful, and all men might, but ſober and temperate men did forbear, and not do it: of theſe three, though the later have prevail'd with thoſe Authors, and be the common opinion; yet the later part of that later opinion, would very hardly fall into proof, That all their ſober and temperate men did forbear this eating of fleſh, or any lawful uſe of Gods creatures. God himſelf took his portion in this world ſo, in meat and drink, in his manifold ſacrifices; and God himſelf gave himſelf in this world ſo, in bread and wine, in the bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his body and his bloud: And the very joys of heaven after the Reſurrection, are convey'd to us alſo, in the Marriage-ſupper of the Lamb. That <hi>menſa laqueus,</hi> which is in the Pſalm, is a curſe:<note place="margin">69.22.</note> 
               <hi>Let their table be made a ſnare,</hi> let their plenty and proſperity be an occaſion of ſin to them, that's a malediction: but for that <hi>menſa propoſitionum,</hi> The table of Shew-bread,<note place="margin">Num. 4.7.</note> where thoſe bleſſings which God had given to man, were brought again, and preſented in his ſight, upon that table; the loaves were great in quantity, and many in number, and often renew'd: God gives plentifully, richly, and will be ſerv'd ſo himſelf. In all thoſe feſtivals, amongſt the Jews, which were of Gods immediate inſtitution, as the Paſſover, and Pentecoſt, and the Trumpets, and Tabernacles, and the reſt, you ſhall often meet in the Scriptures, theſe two phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>Humiliabitis animas;</hi> and then, <hi>Laetaberis coram Domino:</hi> firſt, upon that day, <hi>you ſhall humble your ſouls,</hi> (that you have, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.29. and very often) and then, upon that day, <hi>You ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce before the Lord;</hi> (and that you have, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.11. and very often beſides.) Now ſome Interpreters have applied theſe two phraſes to the two days; That upon the Eve we ſhould humble our ſouls in Faſting, and upon the Day rejoyce before the Lord in a feſtival chearfulneſs: but both belong to the Day it ſelf; that firſt we ſhould humble our ſouls, as we do now, in theſe holy Convocations; and then return, and rejoyce before the Lord, in a chearful uſe of his creatures, our ſelves, and then ſend out a portion to them that want, as it is expreſly enjoyn'd in that feaſt, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.10. and in that, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 9.22. where their feaſting is as literally commanded, as their giving to the poor. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe Stationary and Anniverſary Feaſtings, which were of Gods immediate inſtitution, And that Feaſt which was of the Churches inſtitution after, in the time of the <hi>Macchabees,</hi> which was the <hi>Encoenia,</hi> The Dedication of the Temple; the Jews at this day, in their Diſperſion, obſerve a yearly Feaſt, which they call <hi>Festum Letitiae,</hi> The feaſt of Rejoycing, in a feſtival thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to God, that he hath brought the year about, and afforded them the uſe of the Law, another year. When Chriſt came to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:93368:60"/>
               <hi>Jairus</hi> houſe, and commanded away the Muſick, and all the Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral-ſolemnities, it was not becauſe he diſallowed thoſe ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but becauſe he knew there was no Funeral to be ſolemniz'd in that place, to which he came with an infallible purpoſe to raiſe that maid which was dead. Civil recreations, offices of ſociety and mutual entertainment, and chearful converſation; and ſuch a uſe of Gods creatures, as may teſtifie him to be a God, not of the valleys onely, but of the mountains too, not a God of neceſſity onely, but of plenty too; Chriſt juſtified by his perſonal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence at a Feaſt; which was our firſt: and then, at a Feaſt in an Apoſtles houſe; which is our ſecond circumſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">In Domo Apost.</note>The Apoſtle then had a houſe, and means to keep a houſe, and to make occaſional Feaſts in his houſe, though he had bound himſelf to ſerve Chriſt in ſo near a place as an Apoſtle. The profeſſion of Chriſts ſervice, in the Miniſtery, does not take from any man, the uſe of Gods creatures, nor chearfulneſs of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. As ſome of the other Apoſtles are ſaid to have followed Chriſt, <hi>relictis retibus, They left their nets, and followed him;</hi> and yet upon occaſion, they did at times return to their nets and fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after that; for Chriſt found them at their nets, after his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: ſo S. <hi>Matthew</hi> followed Chriſt, as S. <hi>Luke</hi> expreſſes it; <hi>Relictis omnibus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">5.28.</note> 
               <hi>He left all, and followed Christ;</hi> but not ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely all,<note place="margin">Baſil.</note> as S. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſeems to take it, <hi>Adeo ut non ſolum lucra, ſed &amp; ipſa pericula contempſerit,</hi> that he did not onely neglect the gain of his place, but the danger of diſpleaſure by ſuch a leaving of his Place: for S. <hi>Matthew</hi> was a Publicane, and ſo a publike Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, and an Accountant to the State: But though he did ſo far leave all, as that nothing retarded him from an immediate fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of Chriſt; yet, no doubt but he returned after, to the ſetling of his Office, and the rectifying of his Accounts. When God ſees it neceſſary or behoveful for a man to leave all his worldly ſtate, that he may follow him, God tells him ſo; he gives him ſuch a meaſure of light by his Spirit, as lets him ſee, it is Gods will; and then, to that man, that is a full commandment, and bindes him to do it, and not onely an Evangelical counſel, as they call it, which leaves him at liberty, to do it, or leave it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done: Chriſt ſaw how much was neceſſary to that young man in the Goſpel, and therefore to him he ſaid, <hi>Vade &amp; vende, Go and ſell all that thou hast, and then follow me:</hi> And this was a commandment to that man, though it be not a general commandment to all; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Matthew</hi> Chriſt laid no ſuch commandment, but onely ſaid to him, <hi>Sequere me, Follow me;</hi> and he did ſo; but yet not ſo deveſt himſelf of his worldly eſtate, as that he had not a houſe, and means to keep a houſe, and that plentifully, after this. When <hi>Eliah</hi> us'd that holy faſcination upon <hi>Eliſha,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Reg. 19.19.</note> (we may not, I think, call it a faſcination; faſcination, I think, hath never a

good ſenſe) but when <hi>Eliah</hi> uſed that holy Charm and Incanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon him, to ſpread his Mantle over him, and to draw him with that, as with a net, after him; yet after <hi>Eliſha</hi> had thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a character of Orders, after this impoſition of hands in the ſpreading of the Mantle, after he had this new filiation, by which he was the ſon of the Prophet, yet <hi>Eliſha</hi> went home, and feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his friends after this. So <hi>Matthew</hi> begun his Apoſtleſhip with a feaſt; and though he, in modeſtie forbear ſaying ſo, S. <hi>Luke,</hi>
               <note place="margin">5.29.</note> who reports the ſtory, ſays that it was a <hi>great feast.</hi> He begun with a great, but ended with a greater: for, (if we have S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thews</hi> hiſtory rightly deliver'd to us) when he was at the greateſt feaſt which this world can preſent, when he was receiving and adminiſtring the bleſſed Sacrament, in that action, was he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſerv'd up as a diſh to the table of the Lamb, and added to the number of the Martyrs then; and died for that Saviour of his, whoſe death for him, he did then celebrate. This then was <hi>fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum Ablactationis; Abraham made a great feast,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 21.8.</note> 
               <hi>that day that Iſaac was weaned:</hi> Here was <hi>Matthew</hi> wean'd <hi>ab uteribus mundi,</hi> from the breſts of this world; and he made a feaſt, a feaſt that was a Type of a Tyye, a previſion of a viſion,<note place="margin">Act. 10.</note> of that viſion which S. <hi>Peter</hi> had after, of a ſheet, with all kinde of meats clean and unclean in it: for at this Table was the clean and unſpotted Lamb, Chriſt Jeſus himſelf; and at the ſame Table, thoſe ſpotted and unclean Goats, the Publicans and ſinners; which is our third, and next circumſtance, He juſtified feaſting, feaſting in an Apoſtles houſe, feaſting with Publicans and ſinners.</p>
            <p>Is there then any converſation with notorious ſinners juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, excuſable?<note place="margin">Cum publicanis.</note> We ſee when S. <hi>Paul</hi> came to be of that High Commiſſion, to judge of notorious ſinners, how he proceeded: he <hi>deliver'd Alexander and Hymenaeus to Satan;</hi> and there, ſurely,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.20.</note> he did not mean that any man ſhould keep them company. What was their fault? It was but one Heretical point; a great one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; for they denied the Reſurrection; and for this, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle (as it is alſo ſaid there) <hi>ſends them to Satan, that they might learn not to blaſpheme:</hi> And may there not be thus much intimated in that, That a man may learn more blaſphemy with ſome men, then with Satan himſelf? That may be true: but the ſending and delivering to Satan, is the excluding of that man from the Kingdom, that is, from the viſible Church of Chriſt, by a juſt Excommunication: for, all without the Church, is Satans ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction. Of which fearful ſtate,<note place="margin">Nyſſen.</note>

of a man burning in Hell, for that's thy picture, ſays that Father, to that man; <hi>Non Epiſcopalis arrogantiae exiſtimes,</hi> ſays he, Think it not a paſſionate act of an inſolent Biſhop; <hi>Caepit in Lege, confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur in Gratia,</hi> God began it in the Law, and confirm'd it in the Goſpel; and where it is juſtly grounded, and duely proceeded in, it is a fearful thing to be deliver'd over to Satan by excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and S. <hi>Paul</hi> is ſo far from converſing with an Heretick in one point, as that he proceeds ſo far with him, as <hi>to deliver him to Satan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, for a fault much leſs then this, not oppoſed againſt God, as Hereſie, but againſt Natural Honeſty, the Apoſtle proceeds as far,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.5.</note> in Inceſt; <hi>Gather you,</hi> ſays he, <hi>with my ſpirit, and the power of the Lord Jeſus, to deliver that inceſtuous man to Satan.</hi> Nay, in leſs faults then that,<note place="margin">v. 11.</note> he forbids Converſation; <hi>If a fornicator, if a drunkard, if a covetous perſon, with him eat not.</hi> Nay; for that which is leſs then theſe,<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 3.6, 14.</note> he is as ſevere; <hi>We command ye, Brethren, in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that you withdraw your ſelves from every brother that walketh diſorderly.</hi> Where, <hi>Calvin</hi> thinks, (and, I think, aright, and many others muſt think ſo too; for a Jeſuite thinks ſo, as well as <hi>Calvin</hi>) that the Apoſtle by the word <hi>diſorderly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cornel. Lapid.</note> does not mean perſons that live in any courſe of notorious ſin; but by <hi>diſorderly,</hi> he means <hi>Ignavos, Inutiles,</hi> idle and unprofitable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; perſons of no uſe to the Church, or to the State: that whereas this is <hi>Ordo Divinus,</hi> the order that God hath eſtabliſhed in this world, that every man ſhould embrace a Calling, and walk therein; they who do not ſo, pervert Gods order: and they are <hi>S.

            </p>
            <p>This then being ſo, that the Holy Ghoſt by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſeparates not onely from all ſpiritual Communion, but from all civil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, all notorious ſinners, and diſorderly perſons, how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends Chriſt to this facility, and eaſineſs of converſation with Publicans and Sinners? For, (to ſpeak a word by the way, of the Office of a Publican) though Cuſtomes, and Tributes, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions were due to the Kings of <hi>Jewry,</hi> due in natural right, and due in legal right,<note place="margin">1.17.</note> fixed and eſtabliſhed by that Law in <hi>Samuel;</hi> and ſo the Farmers of thoſe Cuſtomes, and Collectors of thoſe Tributes, in that reſpect not to be blamed, or ill thought of; and though in the Roman State, (under whoſe Government, at this time the Jews were) the Office of a Publican were an honourable Office,<note place="margin">Cicero.</note> (for ſo that great Stateſman and Orator tells us, <hi>Flos Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Romanorum, Ornamentum Civitatis, Firmamentum Reipub.</hi> Men of the beſt Families and Extraction in the State, Men of the beſt Credit and Reputation in the State, Men of the beſt Revenues and Poſſeſſion in the State, were Publicans; yet when the Romans go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd <hi>Jewry</hi> as a Province, and that theſe honourable Roman Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans forbore to execute that Office in thoſe remote parts, and

making under-Farmers there, for the better advancing of that ſervice, employed the Jews themſelves, who beſt underſtood the ways and the perſons: theſe Jews became more cruel and heavy to their Brethren, in theſe Exactions, then any ſtrangers; and ſo, and juſtly, the moſt odious perſons amongſt them: and then why would Chriſt afford this converſation to theſe, and ſuch as theſe, to Publicans and ſinners? Chriſt was in himſelf a Diſpenſation upon any Law, becauſe he was the Law-maker. But here he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not in that capacity; he took no benefit of any Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he fulfilled the intention and purpoſe of the Law; for the Laws therefore forbad converſation with ſinners, leſt a man ſhould take infection by ſuch converſation:<note place="margin">Exod. 34.</note> ſo the Jews were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to eat with the Gentiles; but it was, leſt in eating with the Gentiles, they might eat of things ſacrificed to Idols: ſo they were forbidden converſation with leprous perſons,<note place="margin">Num. 5.</note> leſt by ſuch converſation the diſeaſe ſhould be propagated; but where the danger of infection ceas'd, all converſation might be open; and Chriſt was always far enough from taking any infection, by any converſation with any ſinner. He might apply himſelf to them, becauſe he could take no harm by them; but he did it eſpecially, that he might do good upon them. Some forbear the company of ſinners, out of a ſingularity, and pride in their own purity, and ſay, with thoſe in <hi>Eſay, Stand by thy ſelf, come not near me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">65.5.</note> 
               <hi>for I am holyer then thou.</hi> But, <hi>Bonus non eſt, qui Malos tolerare non poteſt,</hi> ſays <hi>S. Auguſt.</hi> upon thoſe words, <hi>Lilium inter ſpinas,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cant. 2.2.</note> That Chriſt was a Lilie, though he grew amongſt Thorns. A Lilie is not the leſs a Lilie, nor the worſe, nor the darker a Lilie, becauſe it grows a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Thorns. That man is not ſo good as he ſhould be, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not maintain his own integrity, and continue good; or that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not maintain his charity, though others continue bad. It was S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s way, <hi>I am made all things to all men, that I might ſave ſome.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.22.</note> And in that place, which we mentioned before,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.11.</note> where the Apoſtle names the perſons, whom we are to forbear, amongſt them, he names Idolators; and, as he does the reſt, he calls even thoſe Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators, Brethren; <hi>If any that is called a Brother, be an Idolator,</hi> &amp;c. In caſes where we are ſafe from danger of infection, (and it lies much in our ſelves, to ſave our ſelves from infection) even ſome kind of Idolators, are left by <hi>S. Paul</hi> under the name of Brethren; and ſome brotherly, and neighbourly, and pious Offices, belong to them, for all that. Theſe faults muſt arm me to avoid all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from them, but not extinguiſh all charity towards them. And therefore it was an unjuſt calumny in the Phariſees, to impute this for a fault to Chriſt, that he applyed himſelf to theſe men; which is the next and laſt Circumſtance in this firſt part, <hi>The Calumny of theſe Phariſees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in the manner of this Calumny,<note place="margin">Calumnia.</note> there was a great deal
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:93368:62"/>
of iniquity, and a great deal in the matter: For, for the manner; That which they ſay of Chriſt, they ſay not to Chriſt himſelf, but they whiſper it to his ſervants, to his Diſciples. A Legal and Juridical Accuſation, is juſtifiable, maintainable, becauſe it is the proper way for remedy: a private reprehenſion done with diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and moderation, ſhould be acceptable too; but a privy whiſpering is always Phariſaical. The Devil, himſelf, though he be a Lyon, yet he is a roaring Lyon; a man may hear him: but for a privy Whiſperer, we ſhall onely hear of him. And in their plot there was more miſchief; for, when Chriſts Diſciples pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ears of Corn,<note place="margin">Matth. 12.</note> upon the ſabbath, the Phariſees ſaid nothing to thoſe Diſciples, but they come to their Maſter, to Chriſt, and they tell him of it: Here, when Chriſt eats and drinks with theſe ſinners, they never ſay any thing to Chriſt himſelf, but they go to his ſervants, and they tell him of it. By privy whiſperings and calumnies, they would aliene Chriſt from his Diſciples, and his Diſciples from him; the King from his Subjects by ſome tales, and the Subject from the King by other: and they took this for the ſhorteſt way to diſgrace both their preaching, to diſcredit both their lives; to defame Chriſt for a Wine-bibber, and a looſe Companion, and to defame his Diſciples for prophane men, and Sabbath-breakers:<note place="margin">Gregor.</note> for, <hi>Cujus vita deſpicitur, reſtat ut ejus predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio contemnatur,</hi> is an infallible inference and conſequence made by <hi>S. Gregory;</hi> Diſcredit a mans life, and you diſgrace his Preaching: Lay imputations upon the perſon, and that will eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate and fruſtrate all his preaching; for whether it be in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our nature, or whether it be in the nature of the thing it ſelf, ſo it is, if I believe the Preacher to be an ill man, I ſhall not be much the better for his good Sermons.</p>
            <p>Thus they were injurious in the manner of their calumny; they were ſo too in the matter, to calumniate him therefore, becauſe he applyed himſelf to ſinners. The Wiſe-man in <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes his meditation thus:<note place="margin">11.12.</note> 
               <hi>There is one that hath great need of help, full of poverty, yet the eye of the Lord looked upon him for good, and ſet him up from his low eſtate, ſo that many that ſaw it, marvelled at it.</hi> Many marvelled, but none reproached the Lord, chid the Lord, calumniated the Lord, for doing ſo. And if the Lord will look upon a ſinner, and raiſe that bedrid man; if he will look with that eye, that pierces deeper then the eye of heaven, the Sun, (and yet with a look of that eye, the womb of the earth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives) if he will look with that eye, that conveys more warmth then the eye of the Oſtrich, (and yet with a look of that eye, that Bird is ſaid to hatch her young ones, without ſitting) that eye that melted <hi>Peter</hi> into water, and made him flow towards Chriſt; and ratified <hi>Matthew</hi> into air, and made him flee towards Chriſt; if that eye vouchſafe to look upon a Publican, and redeem a <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhen</hi>

out of an <hi>Egypt,</hi> hatch a ſoul out of a carnal man, produce a ſaint out of a ſinner, ſhall we marvel at the matter? marvel ſo, as to doubt Gods power? ſhall any thing be impoſſible to God? or ſhall we marvel at the manner, at any way by which Chriſt ſhall be pleaſed to convey his mercy?<note place="margin">Chryſolog.</note> 
               <hi>Miraris eum peccatorum vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num bibere, qui pro peccatoribus ſanguinem fudit?</hi> ſhall we wonder that Chriſt would live with ſinners, who was content to die for ſinners? Wonder that he would eat the bread and Wine of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that gave ſinners his own fleſh to eat, and his own blood to drink? Or if we do wonder at this, (as, indeed, nothing is more wonderful) yet let us not calumniate, let us not miſ-interpret a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way, that he ſhall be pleaſed to take, to derive his mercy to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man: but,<note place="margin">Clem. Alex.</note> (to uſe <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi>'s compariſon) as we tread upon many herbs negligently in the field, but when we ſee them in an Apothecaries ſhop, we begin to think that there is ſome vertue in them; ſo howſoever we have a perfect hatred, and a religious deſpite againſt a ſinner, as a ſinner; yet if Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſhall have been pleaſed to have come to his door, and to have ſtood, and knock'd, and enter'd, and ſup'd, and brought his diſh, and made himſelf that diſh, and ſeal'd a reconciliation to that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in admitting him to that Table, to that Communion, let us forget the Name of Publican, the Vices of any particular profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and forget the name of ſinner, the hiſtory of any mans for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer life; and be glad to meet that man now in the arms, and to grow up with that man now in the bowels of Chriſt Jeſus; ſince Chriſt doth now begin to make that man his, but now declares to us, that he hath been his, from all eternity: For in the Book of Life, the name of <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> was as ſoon recorded, for all her incontinency, as the name of the bleſſed Virgin, for all her inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity; and the name of St. <hi>Paul</hi> who drew his ſword againſt Chriſt, as ſoon as St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who drew his in defence of him: for the Book of life was not written ſucceſſively, word after word, line after line, but delivered as a Print, all together. There the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſinners were as ſoon recorded, as the moſt righteous; and here Chriſt comes <hi>to call, not the righteous</hi> at all, <hi>but</hi> onely <hi>ſinners to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> And ſo we have done with thoſe pieces which conſtitute our firſt part; Chriſt by his perſonal preſence juſtified feaſting, and feaſting in an Apoſtles houſe, and feaſting with Publicans and ſinners, though the Phariſees calumniated him, malitiouſly in the manner, injuriouſly in the matter; and we paſs to our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part; from the Hiſtorical and Occaſional, to the Catechiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, the Doctrinal Part.</p>
            <p>The other Part, the Occaſion, the Connexion was of the Text;<note place="margin">Part II.</note> and we cannot ſay properly that this Part, the anſwer is in the Text; for, indeed, the Text is in it: the Text it ſelf is but a piece of that Anſwer, which Chriſt gives to theſe Calumniators. Firſt,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:93368:63"/>
Chriſt does afford an Anſwer even to Calumniators; for that is very often neceſſary:<note place="margin">Reſpondet Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniae.</note> not onely becauſe otherwiſe a Calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor would triumph, but becauſe otherwiſe a calumny would not appear to be a calumy. A calumny is fix'd upon the fame of a good man; he in a holy ſcorn, and religious negligence, preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits it; and after, long after, the generation of thoſe vipers come to ſay, In all this time, who ever denyed it? A ſeaſonable and a ſober anſwer interrupts the preſcription of a calumny, diſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues the continual claim of a calumny, diſappoints and avoids that Fine which the calumny levied, to bar all poſterity, if no man ariſe to make an anſwer. Truely, there are ſome paſſages in the Legend of Pope <hi>Joan,</hi> which I am not very apt to believe; yet, it is ſhrewd evidence, that in ſo many hundreds of years, ſix or ſeven, no man in that Church ſhould ſay any thing againſt it: I would they had been pleas'd to have ſaid ſomething, ſomewhat ſooner: for if there were ſlander mingled in the ſtory, (and if there be, it muſt be their own Authors that have mingled it) yet ſlander it ſelf ſhould not be neglected. Chriſt does not neglect it; he juſtifies his converſation with theſe ſinners: and he gives anſwers proportionable to the men, with whom he dealt. Firſt, becauſe the Phariſees pretended a knowledge and zeal to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,<note place="margin">Oſe 6.6.</note> he anſwers out of the Scriptures, out of the Prophet, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſericordiam volo, Mercy is better then ſacrifice;</hi> and an Evangelical deſire to do good upon ſinners, better then a Legal inhibition to come near them. And Chriſt ſeems to have been ſo full of this ſaying of <hi>Oſe,</hi> as that he ſays it here, where the Phariſees calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate him to his diſciples; and when they calumniate the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples about the ſabbath, he ſays it there too. He anſwers out of Scriptures, becauſe they pretend a zeal to them; and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Phariſees were learned, and rational men, he anſwers out of Reaſon too, <hi>The whole have no need of the Phyſician:</hi> I come in the quality of a Phyſician, and therefore apply my ſelf to the ſick. For, we read of many blinde and lame, and deaf and dumb, and dead perſons, that came or were brought to Chriſt to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; but we never read of any man, who being then in a good ſtate of health, came to Chriſt to deſire that he might be preſerv'd in that ſtate: The whole never think of a Phyſician; and therefore Chriſt, who came in that quality, applied himſelf to them that needed. And that he might give full ſatisfaction, even to Calumniators, every way, as he anſwer'd them out of Scriptures, and out of Reaſon; ſo becauſe the Phariſees were States-men too, and led by Precedents and Records, he anſwers out of the tenour and letter of his Commiſſion and Inſtructions, (which is that part of his anſwer that falls moſt directly into our Text) <hi>Veni vocare, I came to call not the righteous, but ſinners to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>

               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:93368:63"/>Firſt then, <hi>venit,</hi> he came, he is come: <hi>venit actu;</hi> he came in promiſe, often ratified before:<note place="margin">Venit Actu.</note> now there is no more room for <hi>John Baptist</hi>'s queſtion, <hi>Tune ille, Art thou he that ſhould come, or must we look for another?</hi> For another coming of the ſame Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, we do look, but not for another Meſſias; we look for none after him, no poſt-Meſſias; we joyn none, Saints nor Angels, with him, no ſub-Meſſias, no vice-Meſſias. The Jews may as well call the hiſtory of the Floud Prophetical, and ask when the world ſhall be drown'd according to that Prophecie; or the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of their deliverance from <hi>Babylon</hi> Prophetical, and ask when they ſhall return from thence to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> according to that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, as ſeek for a Meſſias now amongſt their Prophets, ſo long after all things being perform'd in Chriſt, which were prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied of the Meſſias; Chriſt hath ſo fully made Prophecie Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.</p>

No more then he could have been left out at the Creation, and the world made without him, could he have been ſent into this world, without his own hand to the Warrant, or have been left out at the decree of his ſending. As when he was come, no man could have taken away his ſoul, if he had not laid it down; ſo, (if we might ſo ſpeak) no God, no perſon in the Trinity, could have ſent him, if he had not been willing to come. <hi>Venit actu,</hi> he is come; there's our comfort: <hi>venit ſponte,</hi> he came freely; there's his goodneſs.

pray at firſt, that God would come into me, when as I could not onely not have the ſpirit of prayer, but not the ſpirit of life, and being, except God were in me already? Where was I, when Chriſt call'd me out of my Raggs, nay out of my Ordure, and waſh'd me in the Sacramental water of Baptiſm, and made me a Chriſtian ſo? Where was I, when in the loyns of my ſinful parents, and in the unclean act of generation, Chriſt call'd me into the Covenant, and made me the childe of Chriſtian parents? Could I call upon him, to do either of theſe for me? Or if I may ſeem to have made any ſtep towards Baptiſm, becauſe I was within the Covenant; or towards the Covenant, becauſe I was of Chriſtian parents: yet where was I, when God call'd me, when I was not, as though I had been, in the Eternal Decree of my Election? What ſaid I for my ſelf, or what ſaid any other for me then, when neither I, nor they had any being? God <hi>is found of them that ſought him not: Non venit occurrere,</hi> He came not to meet them who were, of themſelves, ſet out before.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Non Cogere.</note>But then, <hi>non venit cogere,</hi> He came not to force and compel them, who would not be brought into the way: Chriſt ſaves no man againſt his will. There is a word crept into the later School, that deludes many a man; they call it <hi>Irreſistibility;</hi> and they would have it mean, that when God would have a man, he will lay hold upon him, by ſuch a power of grace, as no perverſneſs of that man, can poſſibly reſiſt. There is ſome truth in the thing, ſoberly underſtood: for the grace of God is more powerful then any reſiſtance of any man or devil. But leave the word, where it was hatcht, in the School, and bring it not home, not into pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice: for he that ſtays his converſion upon that, God, at one time or other, will lay hold upon me by ſuch a power of Grace, as I ſhall not be able to reſiſt, may ſtay, till Chriſt come again, to <hi>preach to the ſpirits that are in priſon.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.19.</note> Chriſt beats his Drum, but he does not Preſs men; Chriſt is ſerv'd with Voluntaries. There is a <hi>Compelle intrare,</hi>

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:93368:64"/>
is nothing in conſideration, but Religion meerly. 'Tis true, there is a <hi>Compellite Manere,</hi> that hath all juſtice in it; when men have been baptiz'd, and bred in a Church, and embrac'd the profeſſion of a Religion, ſo as that their allegiance is complicated with their Religion, then it is proper by ſuch Laws to compel them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main and continue in that Religion; for in the Apoſtacy, and Defection of ſuch men, the State hath a detriment, as well as the Church; and therefore the temporal ſword may be drawn as well as the ſpiritual; which is the caſe between thoſe of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh perſwaſion, and us: their Laws work directly upon our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; they draw blood meerly for that, ours work directly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their allegiance, and puniſh only where pretence of Religion colours a Defection in allegiance. But Chriſts end being meerly ſpiritual, to conſtitute a Church, <hi>Non venit Occurrere,</hi> as he came not to meet man, man was not ſo forward; ſo he came not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel man, to deal upon any that was ſo backward; for, <hi>Venit vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care, He came to call.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, this <hi>calling,</hi> implies a voice, as well as a Word;<note place="margin">Veni vocare.</note> it is by the Word; but nor by the Word read at home, though that be a pious exerciſe; nor by the word ſubmitted to private interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; but <hi>by the Word preached,</hi> according to his Ordinance, and under the Great Seal, of his bleſſing upon his Ordinance. So that <hi>preaching</hi> is this <hi>calling;</hi> and therefore, as if Chriſt do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to any man, in the power of a miracle, or in a private inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, yet he appears but in weakneſs, as in an infancy, till he ſpeak, till he bring a man to the hearing of his voice, in a ſetled Church, and in the Ordinance of preaching: ſo how long ſoever Chriſt have dwelt in any State, or any Church, if he grow ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, he is departing; if there be a diſcontinuing, or ſlackning of preaching, there is a danger of looſing Chriſt. <hi>Adam</hi> was not made in Paradiſe, but brought thither, call'd thither: the ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> are not born in the Church, but call'd thither by Baptiſm; <hi>Non Naſcimur ſed re-naſcimur Chriſtiani;</hi>

Even the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect themſelves have not a conſtant righteouſneſs in this world: ſuch a righteouſneſs, as does always denominate them, ſo, as that they can always ſay to their own conſcience, or ſo as the Church can always ſay of them, This is a righteous man: No, nor ſo, as that God, who looks upon a ſinner with the eyes of the Church, and conſiders a ſinner, with the heart and ſenſe of the Church, and ſpeaks of him with the tongue of the Church, can ſay of him, then, when he is under unrepented ſin, This man is righteous: howſoever, if he look upon him, in that Decree which lies in his boſom, and by which he hath infallibly ordain'd him to ſalvation, he may ſay ſo. No man here, though Elect, hath an equal and conſtant righteouſneſs; nay, no man hath any ſuch righteouſneſs of his own, as can ſave him; for howſoever it be made his, by that Application, or Imputation, yet the righteouſneſs that ſaves him, is the very righteouſneſs of Chriſt himſelf.<note place="margin">Hilarie.</note> S. <hi>Hilaries</hi> Queſtion

And upon this Pelagian righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, it thought Nature ſufficient without Grace; or upon this righteouſneſs of the <hi>Cathari,</hi> the Puritans in the Primitive Church, that thought the Grace which they had received ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and that upon that ſtock they were ſafe, and become impec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, and therefore left out of the Lords Prayer, that Petition, <hi>Dimitte nobis, Forgive us our treſpaſſes;</hi> upon this Pelagian righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and this Puritan righteouſneſs, Chriſt does not work. He left out the righteous, not that there were any ſuch, but ſuch as thought themſelves ſo; and he took in ſinners, not all effectually, that were ſimply ſo, but ſuch as the ſenſe of their ſins, and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſtate that that occaſioned, brought to an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they were ſo; <hi>Non Juſtos, ſed peccatores.</hi>

            <p>Here then enters our Affirmative, our Incluſive, Who are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>peccatores:</hi> for here no man asks the Queſtion of the former Branch: there we asked, Whether there were any righteous? and we found none; here we ask not whether there were any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, for we can finde no others, no not one. He came to call ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and only ſinners; that is, only in that capacity, in that contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, as they were ſinners; for of that vain and frivolous opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that got in, and got hold in the later School, That Chriſt had come in the fleſh, though <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood in his innocence; That though Man had nor needed Chriſt as a Redeemer, yet he would have come to have given to man the greateſt Dignity that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might poſſibly receive, which was to be united to the Divine Nature: of this Opinion, one of thoſe Jeſuites whom we named before, <hi>Maldonat,</hi> who oftentimes making his uſe of whole ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of <hi>Calvins,</hi> ſays in the end, This is a good Expoſition, but that he is an Heretick that makes it. He ſays alſo of this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That Chriſt had come, though <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood; this is an ill
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:93368:66"/>
Opinion, but that they are Catholicks that have ſaid it. He came for ſinners; for ſinners onely; elſe he had not come: and then he came for all kind of ſinners:<note place="margin">Mat. 21.31.</note> for, upon thoſe words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours, to the High Prieſts and Phariſees, <hi>Publicans and Harlots go into the Kingdom of Heaven before you,</hi> good Expoſitors note, that in thoſe two Notations, <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Harlots,</hi> many ſorts of ſinners are implyed: in the name of <hi>Publicans,</hi> all ſuch, as by their very profeſſion and calling, are led into tentations, and occaſions of ſin, to which ſome Callings are naturally more expoſed then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſuch as can hardly be exerciſed without ſin; and then in the Name of <hi>Harlots,</hi> and proſtitute Women, ſuch as cannot at all be exerciſed without ſin; whoſe very profeſſion is ſin: and yet for theſe, for the worſt of theſe, for all theſe, there is a voice gone out, Chriſt is come to call ſinners, onely ſinners, all ſinners. Comes he then thus for ſinners? What an advantage had S. <hi>Paul</hi> then, to be of this <hi>Quorum,</hi> and the firſt of them; <hi>Quorum Ego Maximus,</hi> That when Chriſt came to ſave ſinners, he ſhould be the greateſt ſinner, the firſt in that Election? If we ſhould live to ſee that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,<note place="margin">Mat. 24.41.</note> which Chriſt ſpeaks of at the laſt day, <hi>Two in the field, the one taken, the other left,</hi> ſhould we not wonder to ſee him that were left, lay hold upon him that were taken, and offer to go to Heaven before him, therefore, becauſe he had killed more men in the field, or robbed more men upon the High-way, or ſupplanted more in the Court, or oppreſſed more in the City? to make the multiplicity of his ſins, his title to Heaven? Or, <hi>two women grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Mill, one taken, the other left;</hi> to ſee her that was left, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to precede the other into Heaven, therefore, becauſe ſhe had proſtituted her ſelf to more men, then the other had done? Is this S. <hi>Pauls Quorum,</hi> his Dignity, his Prudency; I muſt be ſaved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am the greateſt ſinner? God forbid: God forbid we ſhould preſume upon ſalvation, becauſe we are ſinners; or ſin there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that we may be ſurer of ſalvation. S. <hi>Pauls</hi> title to Heaven, was, not that he was <hi>primus peccator,</hi> but <hi>primus Confeſſor,</hi> that he firſt accuſed himſelf, &amp; came to a ſenſe of his miſerable eſtate; for that implies that which is our laſt word, and the effect of Chriſts calling, That whomſoever he calls, or how, or whenſoever, it is <hi>ad Reſipiſcentiam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Non ad ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factionem.</note> to repentance. It is not <hi>ad ſatisfactionem,</hi> Chriſt does not come to call us, to make ſatisfaction to the juſtice of God: he call'd us to a heavy, to an impoſſible account, if he call'd us to that. If the death of Chriſt Jeſus himſelf, be but a ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for the puniſhment for my ſins, (for nothing leſs then that could have made that ſatisfaction) what can a temporary Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of days or hours do towards a ſatisfaction? And if the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Purgatory it ſelf, ſuſtain'd by my ſelf, be nothing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a ſatisfaction, what can an Evenings faſt, or an <hi>Ave Marie,</hi> from my Executor, or my Aſſignee, after I am dead, do towards
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:93368:66"/>
ſuch a ſatisfaction? Canſt thou ſatisfie the juſtice of God, for all that blood which thou haſt drawn from his Son, in thy blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Oaths and Execrations; or for all that blood of his, which thou haſt ſpilt upon the ground, upon the Dunghil, in thy unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receiving the Sacrament? Canſt thou ſatisfie his juſtice, for having made his Bleſſings the occaſions, and the inſtruments of thy ſins; or for the Dilapidations of his Temple, in having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed thine own body by thine incontinency, and making that, the ſame fleſh with a Harlot? <hi>If he will contend with thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 9.9.</note> 
               <hi>thou canſt not anſwer him one of a thouſand:</hi> Nay, a thouſand men could not anſwer one ſin of one man.</p>
            <p>It is not then <hi>Ad ſatisfactionem;</hi> but it is not <hi>Ad gloriam</hi> neither.<note place="margin">Non ad Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am.</note> Chriſt does not call us to an immediate poſſeſſion of glory, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing any thing between. Our Glorification was in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, as ſoon as our Election: in God who ſees all things at once, both entred at once; but in the Execution of his Decrees here, God carries us by ſteps; he calls us to Repentance. The Farmers of this imaginary ſatisfaction, they that fell it at their own price, in their Indulgencies, have done well, to leave out this Repentance, both in this text in S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and where the ſame is related by S. <hi>Mark.</hi> In both places, they tell us, that Chriſt came <hi>to call ſinners,</hi> but they do not tell us to what; as though it might be enough to call them to their market, to buy their Indulgencies. The Holy Ghoſt tells us; it is <hi>to repentance:</hi> Are ye to learn now what that is? He that cannot define Repentance, he that cannot ſpell it, may have it; and he that hath written whole books, great Volumes of it, may be without it. In one word, (one word will not do it, but in two words) it is <hi>Averſio,</hi> and <hi>Converſio;</hi> it is a turning from our ſins, and a returning to our God. It is both: for in our Age, in our Sickneſs, in any impotencie towards a ſin, in any ſatiety of a ſin, we turn from our ſin, but we turn not to God; we turn to a ſinful delight in the memory of our ſins, and a ſinful deſire that we might continue in them. So alſo in a ſtorm at ſea, in any imminent calamity, at land, we turn to God, to a <hi>Lord, Lord;</hi> but at the next calm, and at the next deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, we turn to our ſin again. He onely is the true Iſraelite, the true penitent, that hath <hi>Nathaniel</hi>'s mark, <hi>In quo non eſt dolus, In whom there is no deceit:</hi> For, to ſin, and think God ſees it not, becauſe we confeſs it not; to confeſs it as ſin, and yet continue the practiſe of it; to diſcontinue the practiſe of it, and continue the poſſeſſion of that, which was got by that ſin; all this is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and deſtroys, evacuates, annihilates all Repentance.</p>
            <p>To recollect all, and to end all: Chriſt juſtifies feaſting; he feaſts you with himſelf: And feaſting in an Apoſtles houſe, in his own houſe; he feaſts you often here: And he admits Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans to this feaſt, men whoſe full and open life, in Court, muſt
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:93368:67"/>
neceſſarily expoſe them, to many hazards of ſin: and the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, our adverſaries, calumniate us for this; they ſay we admit men too eaſily to the Sacrament; without confeſſion, without contrition, without ſatisfaction. God in heaven knows we do not; leſs, much leſs then they. For Confeſſion, we require pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like confeſſion in the Congregation: And in time of Sickneſs, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the death-bed, we enjoyn private and particular Confeſſion, if the conſcience be oppreſſed: And if any man do think, that that which is neceſſary for him, upon his death-bed, is neceſſary, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time he comes to the Communion, and ſo come to ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, if any thing lie upon him, as often as he comes to the Communion, we blame not, we diſſwade not, we diſ-counſel not that tenderneſs of conſcience, and that ſafe proceeding in that good ſoul. For Contrition, we require ſuch a contrition as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to a full deteſtation of the ſin, and a full reſolution, not to relapſe into that ſin: and this they do not in the Romane Church, where they have ſoupled and mollified their Contrition into an Attrition. For Satisfaction, we require ſuch a ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as Man can make to Man, in goods or fame: and for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction due to God, we require that every man, with a ſober and modeſt, but yet with a confident and infallible aſſurance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, the ſatisfaction given to God, by Chriſt, for all mankinde, to have been given and accepted for him in particular. This Chriſt, with joy and thankſgiving we acknowledge to be come; to be come actually; we expect no other after him, we joyn no other to him: And come freely, without any neceſſity impos'd by any above him, and without any invitation from us here: Come, not to meet us, who were not able to riſe, without him; but yet not to force us, to ſave us againſt our wills, but come to call us, by his Ordinances in his Church; us, not as we pretend any righteouſneſs of our own, but as we confeſs our ſelves to be ſinners, and ſinners led by this call, to Repentance; which Repentance, is an everlaſting Divorce from our beloved ſin, and an everlaſting Marriage and ſuper-induction of our ever-living God.</p>

            <p>But becauſe there is no third object for mans love. This world, and the next, are all that he can conſider, as he hath but two eyes, ſo he hath but two objects, and then <hi>Primus actus voluntatis eſt Amor,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aquinas.</note> Mans love is never idle, it is ever directed upon ſomthing, if our love might be drawn from this world, <hi>Solomon</hi> thought it a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect way to convay it upon the next: And therefore conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Solomons</hi> method, and wiſdom in purſuing this way: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all the world together, hath amazing greatneſs, and an amazing glory in it, for the order and harmony, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it (for if a man have many Manors, he thinks himſelf a great Lord, and if a Man have many Lords under him, he is a great King, and if he have Kings under him, he is a great Emperor: and yet what profit were it, <hi>to get all the world and looſe thy ſoule;</hi> Therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> ſhakes the world in peeces, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects it, and cuts it up before thee, that ſo thou mayeſt the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſee, how poor a thing, that particular is, whatſoever it be, that thou ſets thy love upon in this world.

It is not enough to receive a defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it is ſo abſolutely nothing, as that we cannot tell you, what
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:93368:68"/>
it is. Let Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> do it; <hi>vanum eſt, quod nec confert plenitudinem continenti;</hi> for who amongſt you hath not room for another bagg, or amongſt us for another bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; <hi>nec fulcimentum innitentï,</hi> for who ſtands faſt upon that, which is not faſt it ſelf? and the world paſſeth, and the luſts thereof; <hi>Nec fructum laboranti,</hi> for you have ſowen much, and bring in little, <hi>yee eat, but have not enough, yee drink but are not filled, yee are cloth'd, but wax not warm,</hi>

            <p>And ſuch a vanity is this world, leaſt it were not enough, to call it vanity alone, ſimply vanity, though that language in which <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the Holy Ghoſt ſpoke, have no degrees of compariſon, no ſuperlative, (they cannot ſay <hi>vaniſsimum,</hi> the greateſt vanity,) yet <hi>Solomon</hi> hath ſound a way to expreſſe the height of it, another way conformable to that language, when he calls it, <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatem vanitatum,</hi> for ſo doth it; <hi>Canticum Canticorum;</hi> The Song of Songs, <hi>Deus Deorum,</hi> the God of gods, <hi>Dominus dominantium,</hi> The Lord of Lords; <hi>Coeli Coelorum,</hi> The Heaven of Heavens, alwaies ſignifie the ſuperlative, and higheſt degree of thoſe things; vanity of vanities is the deepeſt vanity, the emptieſt vanity, the verieſt vanity that can be conceived. Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> apprehended ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more in it, but upon a miſtaking;<note place="margin">Aug. Retract.</note> for accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming himſelf to a Latin copy of the Scriptures, and ſo lighting upon copies, that had been miſwritten, he reads that, <hi>vanitas vani antum:</hi> O the vanity of thoſe men that delight in vanity; he puts this lowneſs, this annihilation not only in the thing, but in the Men themſelves too. And ſo certainly he might ſafely do; (for though, as he ſaies, in his Retractations, his Copies milled him,) yet that which he collected even by that errour, was true, they that truſt in vain things are as vain, as the things themſelves. If Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> had not his warrant to ſay ſo from <hi>Solomon</hi> here, yet he had it from his Father before, who did not ſtop at that, when he had ſaid Man is like to vanity,<note place="margin">Pſal. 144.4.39.5.</note> but proceeeds farther; ſurely that is without all contradiction every Man, that is without all exception; in his beſt ſtate, that is, without any declination, is altogether vanity. Let no man grudge to acknowledge it of himſelf; The ſecond man that ever was begot and born into this world, (and then there was world enough before him to make
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:93368:69"/>
him great) and the firſt good man, had his name from vanity; <hi>Cain,</hi> the firſt man, had his name from poſſeſſion; but the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, <hi>Habel,</hi> had his name from vacuity, from vanity, from va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing; for it is the very word, that <hi>Solomon</hi> uſes here ſtill for vanity. Becauſe his parents repoſe no confidence in <hi>Habel,</hi> for they thought that <hi>Cain</hi> was the Meſſias, they called him vanity. Becauſe God knew that <hi>Habel</hi> had no long term in this world, he directed them, he ſuffered them to call him vanity. But therefore principally was he and ſo may we, be content with the name of vanity, that ſo acknowledging our ſelves to be but vanity, we may turn, for all our being, and all our well being, for our eſſence, and exiſtence, and ſubſiſtence, upon God <hi>in whom onely we live and move and have our being;</hi> for take us at our beſt, make every one an <hi>Abel,</hi> and yet that is but <hi>Evaneſcentia in nihilum,</hi> a vaniſhing, an evapourating. When the Prophets are ſaid to ſpeak the motions,<note place="margin">Jer. 23.16.</note> and notions, the viſions of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lord, then becauſe that was indeed nothing, (for a lye is nothing) they are ſaid (in this very word) to ſpeak vanity. And ſtill,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8.4.</note> where the Prophets have that phraſe, in the perſon of God, <hi>provocaverunt me vanitatibus, They have provoked God with their vanities,</hi> the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe ever expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it, <hi>Idolis,</hi> with their Idols; and <hi>Idolum nihil eſt,</hi> an Idol,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8.4.</note> that is vanity, is nothing. Man therefore can have no deeper diſcouragement, from enclining to the things of this world, then to be taught that they are nothing, nor higher encouragement, to cleave to God for the next, then to know that himſelf is nothing too.

nothing too; therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> calls this world not onely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, vanity, but affliction, and vexation of ſpirit. Tell a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural voluptuous man, of two ſorts of torments in hell, <hi>Poena damni,</hi> and <hi>Poena ſenſus,</hi> one of privation, he ſhall not ſee God, and the other of reall Torments, he ſhall be actually tormented; the loſs of the ſight of God will not ſo much affect him, for he never ſaw him in his life; not in the marking of his grace, not in the glaſs of his creatures, and he thinks it will not much trouble him there to lack his ſight, whom he never ſaw here; But when he comes to think of reall Torments, he ſees ſome examples of them here in this life upon himſelf. And if he have but the tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, he will think, that if that were to laſt eternally, it were an unſufferable thing. And therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> affects us with that ſenſible addition, love not this world; why? It is vanity, it will come to nothing: I care not for that; I will love it, as long as it is ſomething; do not ſo, for it is not onely vanity, but affliction, vexation too. It will be nothing at laſt, it ends; but it is vexation too, that ſhall never end. The love of the world, is but a ſmoke, there's the vanity; but ſuch a one, as putts out our eyes, there's the vexation; we do not ſee God here, we ſhall not ſee God hereafter.</p>

            <p>To proceed then, riches may do harm to their owners.<note place="margin">Owners.</note> It is no eaſie matter for a rich man, to finde out the true owners of all his riches. Thou art not owner of all, that the right owner cannot recover of thee; that all that is his by law, ſhould be his. Certainly no rich Man hath dealt much in this world, but he hath ſomething, of which himſelf knows not the right owner, when he receives uſury for his money, that intereſt is not his money, but when he receives uſury again for that, there neither the intereſt, nor principal was his own money; he takes uſury for that money of which himſelf was not the owner, becauſe it was ill gotten: If thou do truly know the owner, reſtore it to him; if after a diligent examination of thy ſelf, thou do not know the particular owner, yet thou knoweſt it is none of thine, and therefore give it him, whoſe it was at firſt; both before thou hadſt it, and before he from whom thou gotteſt it corruptly, had it; give it to God, in giving it to his poor, and afflicted members; give it him, and give it willingly, and give it now, for that that thou giveſt at thy death thou doſt but leave by thy laſt will, thou doſt not give; he onely gives that might keep, thou giveſt unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; howſoever they have it, by thy will, yet it is againſt thy will that they have it, thou giveſt then, but art ſorry, that they to whom thou giveſt, that which thou giveſt, came ſo ſoon to it.

And then if it be truely a ſickneſs all the way, and <hi>Morbus complicatus,</hi> (a dropſie, and a conſumption too) we ſeem great, but it is but a ſwelling, for our ſoul is lean; what a ſad condition will there be, when their laſt bodily ſickneſs, and this ſpiritual ſickneſs meet together; a ſick body, &amp; a ſick ſoul, will be but ignorant Phyſitians, and miſerable comforters to one another.</p>

There are middle-men, that when our Church appoints coming, and receiving, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Church forbids both, they will do half of both; they will come, and not receive: and ſo be friends with both. There are ſins recorded in the Scriptures, in which it is hard, for any to find the name, &amp; the nature, what the ſin was; how doth the School vex it ſelf, to find out what was the nature of the ſin of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, or what was the name, of the ſin of <hi>Adam?</hi> There are actions recorded in the Scriptures, in which by Gods ſubſequent pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, there appears ſin to have been committed, and yet to have conſidered the action alone, without the teſtimony of Gods diſpleaſure upon it; a natural man would not eaſily find out a ſin.<note place="margin">Numb. 22.</note>

There are ſins hard to be ſeen, out of the nature of Man, becauſe Man naturally is not watchful upon his particular actions, for if he were ſo, he would eſcape great ſins; when we ſee ſand, we are not much afraid of a ſtone; when a Man ſees his ſmall ſins, there is not ſo much danger of great. But ſome ſins we ſee not out of a natural blindneſs in our ſelves, ſome we ſee not out of a natural dimneſs in the ſin it ſelf. But this ſickly ſin, this ſinful ſickneſs, of gathering Riches, is ſo obvious, ſo manifeſt to every mans apprehenſion, as that the books of Moral men, and Philoſophers are as full of it as the Bible. But yet the Holy Ghoſt, (as he doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, even in moral Counſels) exceeds the Philoſophers; for whereas they place this ſickneſs in gathering unneceſſary riches injuriouſly; the Holy Ghoſt in this place extends i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this, that is threatned here is an abſolute periſhing, an abſolute annihilation; It is the ſame word, by which <hi>David</hi> expreſſes the abolition, and periſhing of the wicked.

            <p>The riches ſhall periſh, though they be his, though his title to them be good, if he put his truſt in them; And thoſe riches, thoſe which he hath got by his travail, Thoſe which he hath reſerved by his parſimony, and frugallity. There is ſomtimes a greater reverence in us, towards our ancient inheritance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe goods, which are devolved upon us, by ſucceſſion; There is another affection expreſſed towards thoſe things, which dying friends have left us, for they preſerve their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; another towards Jewells, or other Teſtimonies of an acceptation of our ſervices from the Prince: but ſtill we love thoſe things moſt, which we have got with our own labour, and induſtrey.

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:93368:75"/>
and now am thus and thus increaſed, a man loves thoſe addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which his owne Induſtry hath made to his fortune. There are ſome ungratefull Natures that love other men the worſe, for having bound them by benefits, and good turns to them: but that were a new ingratitude, not to be thankful to our ſelves, not to love thoſe things, which we our ſelves have compaſſed. We have our reaſon to do ſo, in our great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, Chriſt Jeſus, who loves us moſt, as we are his purchaſe, as he hath bought us with his bloud; And therefore, though he hath expreſſed a love too, to the Angels, in their confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet he cannot be ſaid to love the Angels, as he doth us, becauſe his death hath wrought nothing upon them, which were fallen before; and for us, ſo he came principally to ſave ſinners: the whole body and band of Angels, are not his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, as all mankind is. This affection is in worldly men too; they love their own gettings; and thoſe ſhall periſh. <hi>They have given their pleaſant things for meat,</hi>

               <note place="margin">In occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one.</note>Thoſe riches then, thoſe beſt beloved riches ſhall periſh, and that, ſaith the text, <hi>by evil travail,;</hi> which is a word, that in the original ſignifies both <hi>Occupationem, Negotiationem,</hi> labour and Travail, and <hi>afflictionem, vexationem;</hi> affliction, and vexation: They ſhall periſh in <hi>occupatione,</hi> then when thou art labouring, and travailing in thy calling, then when thou art harkening after a purchaſe, and a bargain, then when thy neighbors can impute no negligence, thou waſt not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in gathering, nay no vice to thee, thou waſt not diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute in ſcattering, then when thou riſeſt early, lyeſt down late, and eateſt the bread of ſorrow, then ſhalt thou find, not onely that that proſpers not, which thou goeſt about, and pretendeſt to, but that that which thou haddeſt before, decaies, and mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders away. If we conſider well in what abundance God ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied the children of Iſrael with Quails, and how that end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we ſhall ſee example enough of this: You ſhall eat, ſaith God,<note place="margin">Num. 11.19.</note> not one nor two daies, nor five, nor ten, nor twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but a whole moneth, until it come out at your noſtrils, and be loathſome unto you; here was the promiſe, and it was performed for the plenty,<note place="margin">ver. 31.</note> that quailes fell a daies journey round about the Camp, and they were two cubits thick upon the earth; The people fell to their labour, and they aroſe, and gathered all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, ſaith the Text;<note place="margin">32.</note> and he that gathered leaſt, gathered ten

               <note place="margin">ver. 33.</note> Even whileſt your money is under your fingers, whileſt it is in your purpoſes determined, and digeſted for ſuch, and ſuch a purpoſe, whileſt you have put it in a ſhip in Merchandice, to win more to it; whileſt you have ſow'd it in the land of borrowers, to multiply, and grow upon Mortgages, and uſury, even when you are in the mid'ſt of your travail, ſtormes at Sea, theeves at land, enviers at court, informations at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> whileſt the meat is in your mouthes, ſhall caſt the wrath of God upon your riches, and they ſhall periſh, <hi>In occupatione,</hi> then, when you travail to increaſe them. The Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are ſaid in that place, onely to have wept to <hi>Moſes,</hi> out of a luſt, and a grief, for want of fleſh. God puniſhed not that weeping; it is a tenderneſs, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that God loves; but a weeping for worldly things, and things not neceſſary to them (for <hi>Manna</hi> might have ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them) a weeping for not having, or for looſing ſuch things of this world, is alwaies accompanied with a murmuring; God ſhall cauſe thy riches to periſh in thy travail, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he denies thee riches, nor becauſe he would not have thee travail, but becauſe an inordinate love, an overſtudious, and an intemperate,, and overlaborious purſuite of riches, is alwaies accompanied with a diffidence, in Gods providence, and a confidence in our own riches.</p>
            <p>To give the wicked a better ſenſe of this, God proceeds often the ſame way, with the righteous too; but with the wicked, becauſe they do with the righteous, leaſt they ſhould truſt in their own riches. We ſee in <hi>Iobs</hi> caſe, It was not onely his Sons, and daughters, who were banquetting, nor onely his aſſes, and ſheep, and camels that were feeding, that were deſtroyed; but upon his Oxen, that were ploughing, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſervants, which were doing rheir particular duties, the <hi>Sabaeans</hi> came, and deſtruction in their ſword; His Oxen, and his ſervants periſhed, <hi>in occupatione,</hi> in their labour, in their travail, when they were doing that, which they ſhould do. And if God do thus to his children, to humble them before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, that they do not ſacrifice to their own nets, not truſt in their own induſtry, nor in their own riches, how much more vehemently ſhall his judgments burn upon them, whoſe purpoſe in gathering Riches, was pricipally, that they might ſtand of themſelves, and not need God. There are beaſts that labour not, but yet furniſh us, with their wool alive, and with their fleſh, when they are dead; as ſheep; there are men,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:93368:76"/>
that deſire riches, and though they do no other good, they are content to keep good houſes, and that their Heire ſhould do ſo, when they are dead; There are beaſts that labour, and are meat at their death, but yield no other help in their life, and theſe are Oxen; there are men that labour to be rich, and do no good with it, till their death; There are beaſts that onely labour, and yield nothing elſe in life, nor death, as horſes: and there are ſome, that do neither, but onely prey upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as Lyons, and others ſuch; we need not apply particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly; there are all beſtial natures in rich men; and God knows how to meet with them all; and much more will he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them, which do no good, in life, nor death, nay that labor not for their riches, but ſurfet upon the ſweat of other men, ſince even the riches of thoſe, that truſt in riches, ſhall periſh <hi>in Occupatione,</hi> in the very labor, and in the very travail, which (if it were not done with a confidence in the riches, when they, are got,) were allowable, and acceptable to God.</p>
            <p>You may have a good Embleme of ſuch a rich man, whoſe riches periſh in his travail, if you take into your memorie, and thoughts, a Spunge that is overfilled; If you preſſe it down with your little finger, the water comes out of it; Nay, if you lift it up, there comes water out of it; If you remove it out of his place, though to the right hand as well as to the left, it poures out water; Nay if it lye ſtill quiet in his place, yet it wets the place, and drops out his moiſture. Such is an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and ſpungy covetous perſon: he muſt pour out, as well as he hath ſuck't in; if the leaſt weight of diſgrace, or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger lye upon him, he bleeds out his money; Nay, if he be raiſed up, if he be prefer'd, he hath no way to it, but by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and he ſhall be raiſ'd, whether he will or no, for it. If he be ſtirr'd from one place to another, if he be ſuffered to ſettle where he is, and would be, ſtill theſe two incommodities lye upon him; that he is loatheſt to part with his money, of any thing, and yet he can do nothing without it. He labours for riches, and ſtill he is but a bagg, for other men: <hi>Pereunt in occupatione,</hi> as faſt as he gather by labour, God raiſes ſome occaſion of drawing them from him again, It is not then with Riches in a family, as it is with a nail in a wall, that the hard beating of it in, makes it the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. It is not the hard and laborious getting of money, the fixing of that in a ſtrong wall, the laying it upon lands, and ſuch things as are vulgarly diſtinguiſhed from moveables, (as though the world, and we were not moveables) nor the beating that nail hard, the bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with Entailes, of Iron, and Adamant, and perpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of eternity, that makes riches permanent, and ſure;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:93368:76"/>
but it is the good purpoſe in the getting, and the good uſe in the having. And this good uſe is not, when thou makeſt good uſe of thy Money, but when the Common-wealth, where God hath given thee thy ſtation, makes uſe of it: The Common-wealth muſt ſuck upon it, by trade, not it upon the Common-wealth, by uſury. Nurſes that give ſuch to children, maintaint hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by it too; but both muſt be done; thou muſt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched ſo, by thy money, as that the ſtate be not impoveriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This is the good uſe in having it; and the good purpoſe in getting it, is, that God may be glorified in it; ſome errours in uſing of Riches, are not ſo dangerous; for ſome imploying of them in exceſſes, and ſuperfluities, this is a ruſt, without, it will be fill'd of with good counſel, or it will be worn of in time; in time we come to ſee the vanity of it: and when we leave looking at other mens cloaths, or thinking them the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter men for their cloaths, why ſhould we think, that others like us the better for our cloaths; thoſe deſires will decay in us. But an ill purpoſe in getting of them, that we might ſtand of our ſelves, and rely upon our Riches, this is a ruſt, a cancer at the heart, and is incurable. And therefore, if as the courſe, and progreſs of money hath been in the world from the beginning. (The obſervation is St. <hi>Auguſtins,</hi> but it is obvious to every man acquainted with hiſtory.) That firſt the world uſed Iron money, and then Silver money, and laſt of all, Gold; If thy firſt purpoſe in getting, have been for Iron, (that thou have intended thy money to be thy ſtrength, and defence in all calamities.) And then for ſilver (to provide thee abundance, and ornaments, and exceſſes.) And then for gold, to hord, and treaſure up in a little room.<note place="margin">Rom. 2.5.</note> 
               <hi>Theſauriſaſti iram.</hi> Thou haſt treaſured up the anger of God, againſt the day of anger.</p>
            <p>Go the ſame way ſtill; account Riches Iron, (naturally apt to receive thoſe ruſts which we ſpoke of, in getting, and uſing) account them ſilver, (naturally intended to provide thee of things neceſſary) but at laſt come to account them gold, naturally diſpoſed to make thee a treaſure in heaven, in the right uſe of them.</p>
            <p>This is the true value of them; and except thou value them thus, <hi>Niſi Dominus edificaverit inſi Dominius cuſtodierit.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 127.</note> Except the Lord build, except the Lord watch, the houſe, and city periſh; ſo except the Lord and his glory, be in thy travail, it is not ſaid thou ſhalt not get by thy tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.

Now travail, did not begin in that curſe, <hi>In Sudore vultus;</hi> for <hi>Adam</hi> was appointed to dreſs paradiſe, and to keep paradiſe before; and that implied a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. But then became his travail to be evil travail, when ſeeing that he could not get bread without travail; ſtill that refreſhed to him the guiltineſs of that ſin, which had dejected him, to that miſery. Then doth the rich Man ſee, That his riches periſh by evil travail, when he calls himſelfe to account, and findes that he truſted wholly to his own travail, and not to the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of God. So alſo every affliction is not evil: it is rather evil to have none; if ye be without correction, you are ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards, and not ſons. Gods own and onely eſſential Son, Chriſt Jeſus, ſuffered moſt; and his adopted ſons, muſt fulfill his ſufferings in their fleſh, we are born Gods ſons, and heirs, in his purpoſe at firſt; and we are declared to be ſo, in our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond birth of Baptiſme, but yet we are not come to years, not come to a tryal, how we can govern our ſelves, till we ſuffer afflictions, but then doth this affliction become evil, when that which God intended for phyſick, we turn into poyſon: when God hearkens after this affliction, to hear what voice it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces, and when he looks for repentance, he hears a murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and repining, when he bends down his ear, for a <hi>Tibi peccavi,</hi> he hears a <hi>Quare non mortuus?

O Lord, according to their work, Give them a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of heart, thy curſe to them; as it is there,) (though there, not by way of murmuring, but by way of foreſight, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, that God would do ſo.) But to end this part, then when the Rich man can make no good uſe of his affliction, when he finds, <hi>Nullam anſam,</hi> no handle in it, to take hold of God by, when he can find no comfort in the next world, he ſhall looſe all here too. And his Riches, Thoſe Riches, which his labour hath made dear unto him, ſhall not onely be taken from him, and he put to his recovery, but they ſhall periſh, and they ſhall periſh in the midd'ſt of thoſe labours, which are evil, and eat him up, and macerate him. And they ſhall periſh in theſe affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which are evil too, which ſhall not work, nor conduce to his good.</p>
            <p>We come now to the ſecond part:<note place="margin">2. Part.</note> which reſpects more the future; <hi>He begotteth a Son;</hi> firſt that may ſeem to give him ſome eaſe; every body deſires it. And ſecondly, It may ſeem to give him ſome excuſe of his gathering, becauſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving children, he was bound to provide for them. But ſuch is Gods indignation for the getting of Riches with a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in them, that he looſes all, all comfort in his Son, all excuſe in himſelf, for in the hands of his Son ſhall be nothing. Firſt then, for the having of children, and the teſtimony of Gods love in that bleſſing, this diminiſhes Nothing, the honour due to the firſt chaſtity, the chaſtity of virginity. There is a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity in Marriage: But the chaſtity of virginity, is the proper, and principal chaſtity. <hi>Barcenus,</hi> amongſt the Iews was an ignominious thing; but it was conſidered onely in them which did marry, and were barren: God hath given us Marriage for Phyſick; but it is an unwholſom wantonneſs to take Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick before we need it: Marriage, In Gods inſtitution at firſt, had but two ends; <hi>In prolem,</hi> and <hi>in adjutorium;</hi> After man was fallen ſick, then another was added, <hi>In remedium.</hi> Marriage is properly according to Gods inſtitution, when all theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr: where none do it is ſcarce a Marriage.

And therefore, when God hath given us that uſe of Marriage, (we are married) he is at an end of his Phyſick; he doth not appoint us to take Phyſick again for children: he does not forbid us to take phiſick, to preſerve our bodyes in a good, and healthy coſtitution; but drugs, and broths, and baths, purpoſely for children, come not

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is evident in it ſelf, and agreed by all, that this is a prophecy of a deliverance; but from what calamity it is a deliverance, or when this prophecy was accompliſhed, is not ſo evident, nor ſo conſtantly agreed upon. All the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions may well be reduced to three; firſt, that it is a deliverance from the captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and then the benefit appertains onely to the Jews, and their deliverer, and Redeemer is <hi>Cyrus;</hi> Secondly, that it is a deliverance from perſecutions in the primitive Church, and ſo it appertains one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Chriſtians, and their Redeemer, from thoſe perſecutions is <hi>Conſtantine;</hi> And thirdly that it is a deliverance from the ſting and bondage of death by ſin; and ſo it appertains to the whole world, and the Redeemer of the whole world is Chriſt Jeſus: For the firſt, ſince both the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe, and the Jewiſh <hi>Rabbins</hi> themſelves, do interpret this to be a prophecy of the Meſſias, becauſe they labour ever more, as ſtrongly as they can, to wring our weapons out of our hands, and to take from us, many of thoſe arguments, which we take from the Prophets, for the proof of the Meſſias: it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us therefore to hold faſt, as much as they grant us, and not to interpret this place of a temporal deliverance from <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> but of the deliverance by the Meſſias. And for the ſecond, which is the deliverance of the chriſtians, from the perſecutions
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:93368:80"/>
in the primitive times, though the Chriſtians did then with a holy cheerfulneſs ſuffer thoſe perſecutions, when they could not avoid them, without prevaricating, and betraying the hour of Chriſt Jeſus, yet they did not wilfully thruſt themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe dangers, they did not provoke the Magiſtrate; And the word which is here tranſlated, <hi>ye ſold your ſelves, vendictiſtis vos,</hi> implies <hi>actionem ſpontaneam,</hi> a free and voluntary action, done by themſelves, and therefore cannot well be underſtood of the perſecutions in the Primitive Church. The third there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as yet is the moſt uſefull, and moſt received, ſo it is the moſt proper acceptation of the word, that it is a deliverance from the bondage of ſin, to be wrought by Chriſt: for as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> ſays, this Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> is rather an Evangeliſt, than a Prophet, becauſe almoſt all that Chriſt did, and ſaid, and ſuffered, is foretold, and prophetically antidated in his prophecy, and almoſt all his prophecy hath ſome relation (at leaſt in a ſecondary ſenſe of accommodation, (where it is not ſo primarily) and literally) to the words and actions, and paſſions of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Following then this interpretation in general of the word, that it is a deliverance from the wages of ſin, <hi>Death,</hi> by Chriſt we may take, in paſſing a ſhort view, of the miſerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man, wherin he enwraped himſelf, &amp; of the aboundant mercy of Chriſt Jeſus in withdrawing him from that univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal calamity, by conſidering onely the ſenſe, and largeneſs, and extention of thoſe words, in which the holy Ghoſt hath been pleaſed to expreſs both theſe in this Text. For firſt, the word in which our action is expreſſed, which is <hi>Machar verdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtis,</hi> ye have ſold, ſignifies in many places of Scripture, <hi>dare proreatia,</hi> a permutation, an exchange of one thing for another; and in other places it ſignifies <hi>Dedére,</hi> upon any little attempt to forſake and abandon our defences, and to ſuffer the enemy eaſily to prevail upon us; ſo alſo it ſignifies <hi>Tradere,</hi> not onely to forſake our ſelves, but to concur actually to the delivering up of our ſelves; and laſtly, it ſignifies <hi>Repellere,</hi> to joyn with our enemies in beating back any that ſhould come to our relief, and reſcue. And then, as we have ſo ſold our ſelves, for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Act, as is expreſſed in that word <hi>Machar,</hi> we have exchanged our ſelves at an undervalue, and worſe than that, we have yeelded up our ſelves upon eaſie tentations, and worſe than that, we have offered our ſelves, expoſed our ſelves, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited the devil, and tempted temptations, and worſe than that, we have Rejected the ſuccours and the ſupplies which have been offered us in the means and conduits, and ſeals of his Graces. As it ſtands thus with us, for the matter, ſo for the manner, how we have done this, that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:93368:80"/>
is expreſſed in that other word, <hi>kinnan</hi> which ſignifies <hi>fecit,</hi> as it is here, <hi>Gratis,</hi> for nought. And in another place, <hi>Fruſtra,</hi> to no purpoſe; for it is a void bargain, becauſe we had no title, no intereſt in our ſelves, when we ſold our ſelves; and it ſignifies, <hi>temere,</hi> raſhly, without conſideration of our own va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, upon whom God had ſtamped his Image; And then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain it ſignifies, <hi>Immerito,</hi> undeſervedly, before God, in whoſe juriſdiction we were by many titles, had forſaken us, or done any thing to make us forſake him. So that our action in ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling our ſelves for nothing, hath this latitude, That man whom God hath dignified ſo much, as that in the Creation he imprinted his Image in him, and in the Redemption he aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not the Image, but the very nature of man, That man whom God ſtill preſerved as the Aple of his Eye, and (as he expreſſes himſelf often in the Prophets) is content to reaſon, and to diſpute with man, and to ſubmit himſelf to any tryal whither he have not been a gracious God unto him: That this man ſhould thus abandon this God, and exchange his ſoul for any thing in this world, when as it can profit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, to gain the whole world and looſe our own ſoul, and not exchange it, but give it away, thruſt it off, and be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to the devil, to tempt the tempter himſelf to take it. But then, as the word aggravates our condemnation, ſo it implies a conſolation too; for it is <hi>fructra,</hi> That is unprovidently, unthriftily, inconſideratly, vainly, and that multiplies our fault, but then it is invalidly, and uneffectually too; that is, it is a void bargain; and when our powerful Redeemer, is pleaſed to come, and claim his right, and ſet on foot his title, all this improvident bargain of ours is voided, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed, and not though, but becauſe we have ſold our ſelves, for nought, we ſhall be redeemed without money.</p>
            <p>For the other word, in which the action of our Redeemer is expreſſed, though it have ſomewhat different uſes in the Scriptures, yet it is evermore ſpoken of him, <hi>Qui habet jus re dimendi,</hi> no man, by the Law could redeem a thing, but he who had a title to that thing. So the word is uſed, <hi>where there are given Cities of refuge from the avenge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>..</hi> There the word is, <hi>a redemptor,</hi> from him that hath right to redeem his kinſmans blood, to bring an Appeal, and to proſecute for the death of his kinſman, who was ſlaine. So is the word uſed alſo, where that Law is given, &amp;c. <hi>If thy brother be impoveriſhed, &amp; he ſell his poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then his redeemer &amp;c.</hi> That is, he that is next to that land; And ſo alſo, when a man dyed without iſſue, he who had the right, and the obligation, to raiſe ſeed to the dead man, he was the redeemer: <hi>I am thy kinſman,</hi> ſaith <hi>Booz</hi> to <hi>Ruth,</hi> but ſaith he, <hi>Alius Redemptor magis propinquus.</hi>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:93368:81"/>
Thou haſt another Redeemer, nearer in blood then I am. How ill a bargain ſoever we made for our ſelves, Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus hath not loſt his right in us, but is our Redeemer in all theſe acceptations of the world: He is our ſanctuary and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge; when we have commited ſpiritual murder upon our own Souls, he preſerves us, and delivers us to the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ordained for us: when we have ſold our poſſeſſions, our natural faculties, He ſupplies us with grace, and feeds us with his Word, and cloaths us with his Sacraments, and warms us with his Abſolutions, againſt all diffidence, which had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly frozen us up: and in our barrenneſs, he raiſes up ſeed unto our dead ſouls, thoughts, and works, worthy of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.

            <p>The ſecond incommodity is, <hi>Teſtamentum non facit,</hi> The Prodigal perſon hath no power allowed him by the Law, to make a will, at his death: And this alſo doth an habitual ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſuffer: For, when he comes to his end, he may dictate to a Notary, and he may bid him write, <hi>Imprimis,</hi> I give my Soul to God, my Body to ſuch a Church, my Goods to ſuch, and ſuch perſons: But if thoſe Goods be l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>able to other debts, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Leg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tarie; ſhall have no profit; If the perſon be under excommunication, he ſhall not lye in that Church; If his ſoul be under the weight of unrepented ſins, God will do the devil no wrong, he will not take a ſoul, that is ſold to him before.</p>
            <p>The third Incommodity that a Prodigal incurrs by the Law, is, <hi>Exhaeredatus creditur,</hi> He is preſum'd to be diſinhe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rited by his father; that whereas, by that Law, if the father, in his Will, leave out any of his childrens names, and never mention him, yet that child which is pretermitted, ſhall come in for a childs part, except the father have aſſigned a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reaſon why he left him out; If this childe were a Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, there needs no other reaſon to be aſſigned, but <hi>Exhaereda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Creditur,</hi> He is preſum'd to be diſinherited. And ſo alſo, if we have ſeen a man prodigal of his own ſoul, and run on in a courſe of ſin, all his life, except there appear very evident ſigns of reſumption into Gods grace, at his end, <hi>Exhaeredatus Creditur,</hi> we have juſt reaſon to be afraid, that he is diſinhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited. If any ſuch ſinner ſeem to thee to repent at his end, <hi>Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eor vobis non negamus, quod petit,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtin:</hi> I confeſs, we ought not to deny him, any help that he deſires in that late
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:93368:82"/>
extremity? <hi>Sed non praeſumimus quia bene exit,</hi> I dare not aſſure you, that that man dyes in a good ſtate; he adds that vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, <hi>non praeſumo, non vos fallo, non praeſumo:</hi> I ſhould but deceive you, if I ſhould aſſure you, that ſuch a man dyed well. There was one good and happy Thief, that ſtole a Salvation, at the crucifying of Chriſt; but in him, that was throughly true, which is proverbially ſpoken, <hi>Occaſio facit furem,</hi> the oppotunity made him a thief: and when there is ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opportunity, there may be ſuch another theif; when Chriſt is to dye again, we may preſume of mercy, upon ſuch a late repentance at our death. The preventing grace of God, made him lay violent hands upon heaven. But when thou art a Prodigal of thy ſoul, will God be a prodigal too, for thy ſake, and betray and proſtitute the kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for a ſigh, or a groan, in which thy pain may have a greater part than thy repentance. God can raiſe up children out of the ſtones of the ſtreet, and therefore he might be as liberal as he would of his people, and ſuffer them to be ſold for old ſhoes; but Chriſt will not ſell his birth-right for a meſſe or pottage, the kingdome of Heaven, for the dole at a Funeral. Heaven is not to be had in exchange for an Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, or a Chantry, or a Colledge erected in thy laſt will: It is not onely the ſelling all we have that muſt buy that pearl, which repreſents the kingdome of Heaven; The giving of all that we have to the poor, at our death, will not do it; the pearl muſt be ſought, and found before, in an even and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant courſe of Sanctification; we muſt be thrifty all our life, or we ſhall be to poor for that purchaſe.</p>
            <p>It is then an unthrifty, a perplexed bargain, when both the buyer, and the ſeller looſe; our loſſe is plain enough, for we looſe our ſouls: And certainly, howſoever the devil be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed to take ſome joy at the winning of a ſinner, howſo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ever his kingdome be thereby enlarged, yet Almighty God ſuffers not his treaſon, his undermining of man, to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed, but afflicts him with more and more accidental tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, even for that; as a licencious man takes pleaſure in the victory of having corrupted a woman, by his ſolicitation, but yet inſenſibly overthrows his conſtitution by his ſin; ſo the withdrawing of Gods Subjects, from his alleigance, induces an addition of puniſhment upon the devil himſelf.</p>
            <p>Conſider a little further, our wretchedneſs, in this prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality; we think, thoſe Laws barbarous and inhumane, which permit the ſute of men in debt, for the ſatisfaction of Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; but we ſell our ſelves, and grow the farther in debt, by being ſold; we are ſold, and to even rate our debts, and to aggravate our condemnation. We find in the hiſtory of the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:93368:82"/>
               <hi>Muſcovits,</hi> that it is an ordinary detainder amongſt them, to ſell themſelves, and their poſterity, into everlaſting bondage, for hot drink: In one winter, a wretched man will drink himſelf, and his poſterity, into perpetual ſlavery. But we ſell our ſelves, not for drink, but for thirſt: we are ſory when our appetite too ſoon decaies, and we would fain ſin more than we do. At what a high rate did the bleſſed Martyrs ſell their bodies; They built up Gods Church with their blood: They ſowed his field, and prepared his harveſt with their blood: they got heaven for their bodies, and we give bodies, &amp; ſouls for hell.</p>
            <p>In a right inventary, every man that aſcends to a true va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of himſelf, conſiders it thus; Firſt, His Soul, then His life; after his fame and good name: And laſtly, his goods and eſtate; for thus their own nature hath ranked them, and thus they are (as in nature) ſo ordinarily in legal conſideration preferred before one another. But for our ſouls, becauſe we know not, how they came into us, we care not how they go out; becauſe, if I aske a Philoſopher, whither my ſoul came in, by propagation from my parents, or by an immediate infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from God, perchance he cannot tell, ſo I think, a divine can no more tell me, whither, when my ſoul goes out of me, it be likely to turn on the right, or on the left hand, if I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in this courſe of ſin. And then, for the ſecond thing in this inventary, Life; the Devil himſelf ſaid true, <hi>skin for skin, and all that a man hath, will he give for his life;</hi> Indeed we do not eaſily give away our lives expreſly, and at once; but we do very eaſily ſuffer our ſelves to be couſened of our lives: we pour in death in drink, and we call that health, we know our life to be but a ſpan, and yet we can waſh away one inche in ryot, we can burn away one inch in luſt, we can bleed away one inch in quarrels, we have not an inch for every ſin; and if we do not pour out our lives, yet we drop them away. For the third peece of our ſelf, our fame and reputation, who had not rather be thought an uſurer, then a beggar? who had not rather be the object of envy, by being great, than of ſcorn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, by being poor, upon any conditions? And for the laſt of all which is our goods,<note place="margin">Seneca.</note> though our coveteouſneſs appears moſt, in the love of them, in that loweſt thing of all (<hi>Adeo omnia homini cariora ſeipſo,</hi> ſo much does every man think every inferiour thing better than himſelf, than his fame, than his body, than his ſoul; which is a moſt perverſe undervaluing of himſelf, and a damnable humility) yet even with theſe goods alſo, (as highly as he values them) a man will paſt if to fuell, and foment, and maintain that ſin, that he delights in: that which is the moſt precious, our ſouls, we undervalue moſt; and that which we do eſteem moſt, (though naturally it ſhould be
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:93368:83"/>
loweſt) our eſtate, we are content to waſt, and diſſipate for our ſins: And whereas the Heathens needed laws to reſtrain them, from an expenſive, and waſtful worſhip of their Gods, every man was ſo apt to exceed in ſacrifices and ſuch other reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious duties, til that law, <hi>Deus frugi Colunto</hi> Let men be thrifty &amp; moderate in religious expenſes, was enacted, (which law was a kind of mortmain, and inhibition, That every man might not beſtow what he would, upon the ſervice of thoſe Gods) we have turned our prodigality the other way, upon the devil, whom we have made <hi>Haeredem in eſſe</hi> and our ſole executor, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed ſoul, and life, and fame, and fortune, all the gifts of God, and God himſelf, by making his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and his Sacraments, and the profeſſion of his name, in an hypocriticall uſe of them, to be the devils inſtruments, to draw us the eaſilyer, and hold us the faſter; and what prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality can be conceived to exceed this, in which we do not onely miſpend our ſelves,<note place="margin">Nihil.</note> but miſpend our God.</p>
            <p>The other point in this exprobration is, that, as we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digally ſold our ſelves, ſo we have inconſiderately ſold our ſelves for nothing; we have in our bargain, diſeaſes, and we have poverty, and we have unſenſibleneſs of our miſeries; but diſeaſes are but privations of health, and poverty but a priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wealth, and unſenſibleneſs but a privation of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Conſcience; all are privations, and privations are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. if a man had got nothing by a bargain but repentance, he would think, and juſtly, he had got little: but if thou hadſt repentance in this bargain, thy bargain were the better; if thou couldſt come to think thy bargain bad, it were a good bargain; but the height of the miſery is in this, that one of thoſe nothings, for which we have ſold our ſelves is a ſtupidity, an unſenſibleneſs of our own wretchedneſs.</p>
            <p>The Laws do annull, and make void fraudulent conveyances; and then the laws preſume fraud in the conveyance, if at leaſt half the value of the thing be not given: now if the whole world be not worth one ſoul, who can ſay, that he hath half his value? it were not meerly nothing, if (conſidering that inventary, which we ſpoke of before) we had the worſe for the better; that were but an ill exchange, but yet it were not nothing. If we had bodies for our ſouls, it were not meerly nothing; but we finde, that ſin that ſells our ſouls, decays and withers our bodies; our bodies grow incapable of that ſin, unable to commit that ſin, which we ſold our ſouls for. If we had fame and reputation for out bodies, it were not nothing: but we ſee, that Heretiques, that give their bodies to the fire, are by the very law, infamous, and they are infamous in every mans apprehenſion. If we had worldly goods for loſs of fame, and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:93368:83"/>
of our good name, yet ſtill it were not nothing; but we ſee that witches, who are infamous perſons, for the moſt part, live in extreme beggery too. So that the exprobration is juſt, we have ſold our ſelves for nothing; and however the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary murmuring may be true, in other things, that all things are grown dearer, our ſouls are ſtill cheap enough, which at firſt were all ſold in groſs, for (perchance) an Apple, and are now retailed every day for nothing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joſeph</hi> was ſold underfoot by his brethren; but it is hard to ſay, for how much; ſome Copies have that he was ſold for 20 pieces, and ſome for 25, and ſome for 30: and S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> collects arguments, at leaſt, alluſions, from this variety of Copies: but all theſe ſay, it was but ſo many pieces of ſilver. The <hi>Septuagints,</hi> in their tranſlation, extend them to gold, to ſo many crowns, or ſuch: <hi>Joſephus</hi> multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies them to pounds, ſo many pounds: all think it too low a price for <hi>Joſeph,</hi> to be ſold for twenty pieces of ſilver. But yet if it were ſo, this was not for nothing; and for this ſelling, his brethren had ſome pretence of excuſe <hi>ne polluantur manus,</hi> they would but ſell him, leaſt their hands ſhould be defiled with blood: but we ſell our ſelves, <hi>ut polluantur manus,</hi> therefore, that our hands may be defiled with blood, even with our own blood, with the loſs of our bodies, which we conſume by ſin, and of our ſouls, which periſh eternally by it.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour Chriſt, every drop of whoſe blood was of in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>finite value (for one of our ſouls is more worth than the whole world, and one drop of his blood had been ſufficient for all the ſouls of 1000 worlds, if it had been applied unto them) was ſold ſcornfully and baſely, at a low price; at moſt, not above ſix pound of our money; but vve ſell our ſelves, and him too, we crucifie him again every day, for nothing: &amp; when our ſin is the very crucifying of him, that ſhould ſave us, who ſhall ſave us? Earthly Princes have been ſo jealous of their honours, as that they have made it Treaſon, to carry their pictures into any low Office, or into any irreverend place. Beloved, whenſoever we commit any ſin, upon diſcourſe, upon conſideration, upon purpoſe, and plot, the image of God which is engraved and imprinted in us, and lodged in our underſtanding, and in that reaſon which we employ in that ſin, is mingled with that ſin; we draw the image of God into all our incontinencies, into all our oppreſſions, into all our extortions, and ſupplantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: we carry his image, into all ſoul places, which we haunt upon earth; yea we carry his image down with us, to eternal condemnation: for, even in Hell, <hi>uri poteſt, non exuri Imago Dei,</hi> ſays S. <hi>Bernard;</hi> The image of God burns in us in hell, but can never be burnt out of us: as long as the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſoul remains, the Image of God remains in it, and ſo
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:93368:84"/>
we have uſed the image of God, as witches are ſaid to do the images of men; by wounding or melting the image, they deſtroy the perſon: and we by defacing the image of God in our ſelves by ſin, to the painful &amp; ſhameful death of the Croſs.</p>

               <hi>Rachel</hi> and <hi>Lea</hi> complained of their father <hi>Laban,</hi> thus, <hi>He hath ſold us, and hath eat, and conſumed the money;</hi> they lamented it much, to ſee themſelves ſold, and by their father, and their father never the better for the bargain. But ſtill our caſe is worſe than any; the devil hath bought us, and he, he who hath bought us, hath eaten and conſumed the money: he pretends to buy us, by giving us pleaſure, or profit for our ſelves, and then thoſe very pleaſures, and thoſe riches, which he pretends to give us, are his food, and his inſtruments, to effect his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous, and tyrannous purpoſes upon us. And therefore let no man think himſelf exempt from this challenge, that he hath ſold himſelf for nothing. Let no man preſent his Dutals, his Court-rolls, his Bacus, his good Debts, his titles of honour, his Maces, or his Staves, or his Enſignes of power and Office, and ſay, call you all this nothing? Compare all theſe with thy ſoul, and they are nothing. Now, whileſt thou walloweſt in all theſe here, thou mayeſt hear God ſay, <hi>Quid habes, quod non accepiſti, What haſt thou of all this, which thou haſt not received;</hi> but when the Bell tols, then he ſhall ſay, in the voyce of that Bell, <hi>Quid habes quod accepiſti,</hi> What haſt thou of all that thou haſt received? Is not all that come to nothing? and then thou that thoughteſt thy ſelf ſtrong enough in purſe, in power, in favour, to compaſs any thing, and to embrace many things, ſhalt not finde thy ſelf able to attain to a door-keepers place in the kingdome of heaven.</p>
            <p>Let no man therefore take too much joy, to apply to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thoſe words of the parable, <hi>Filii ſaeculi, The children of this world</hi> (which grow rich) <hi>are wiſer than the children of light;</hi> for it is but, <hi>In generatione ſua, Wiſer in their generation;</hi> and how litle a while that generation ſhall laſt, God knows; and what fools they ſhall appear to be, for all generations after, we know. They are called the wiſeſt amongſt men, as the Serpent was called the wiſeſt amongſt Beaſts, that is, ſtill, the fitteſt for the devil to work in, to make his inſtruments, and engines to deſire a curſe upon themſelves, and their poſterity. Let no man wreſt Gods example to his purpoſe, and ſay, if he do ſell himſelf for nothing, he does but as God himſelf did, and as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> told him he did,<note place="margin">Pſal. 44.</note> 
               <hi>Thou ſelleſt thy people without gain, and doeſt not increaſe their price.</hi> That was not for nothing; God had his end in that: neither was it an abſolute ſale; but a ſhort term: God ſels us over to ſickneſs, to tribulations, to afflictions, for ſometime; perchance for the whole term, of this ſhort life; but all this is but to improve us, and that we may be the fitter for him when he
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:93368:84"/>
Takes us into his owne hand again, in that ſurrender of our ſelf, <hi>In manus tuas,</hi> when we ſhall deliver up our ſouls: to him, that gave them: for here no propriety is Deſtroyed, ſtill here is <hi>meum &amp; tuum</hi> betwen God and me; It is ſtill my ſoul, and ſtill his ſoul; and when God looked mercyfully towards <hi>Job</hi> then Satans leaſe expired.

Cor. 6.</note> It is <hi>pretiore</hi> ye are pretiouſly bought, even with the pretious blood, of the onely Sone of God. And for our temporall and ſecular value, in Gods account, we ſee how God expreſſed his care of the people, when he diverted <hi>Sennachrib,</hi> from afflicting them,<note place="margin">Eſa. 43.</note> by turning him upon other wars. <hi>I gave Egypt for thy ranſome, Ethiopia, and ſeba for the, becauſe thou waſt pretious in my ſight, and thou waſt honourable, and I loved the; therfore will I give man for the, and people for thy ſake.</hi> And this leads us in to the ſecond part, The Conſolation, that Though, nay, <hi>becauſe we have ſold our ſelves for nothing, we ſhall be Redemed with out mony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Into this part then, there is at firſt a ſtrange Enterance;<note place="margin">2 Part.</note> Therfore, That therfore, becauſe we have ſold our ſelves we ſhould be redeemed; Therefore becauſe we have been prodigal, we ſhould be made rich. But, this Therfore, this reaſon, relates to the priſe, not to the worke of the Redemption, Becauſe it was for nothing, that we were ſold, it is without money, that we are Redeemed: for, for that, there is reaſon in Equity: but for the Redemption itſelf, there is no therfore, no reaſon at all: to be aſſigned, but onley the Eternall goodneſs of God himſelf, and the Eternall purpoſe of his will: Of which will of God, whoſoever ſeeks a reaſon, <hi>Aliquid majus Deo quaerit,</hi> ſays S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> he that ſeeks what perſwaded or inclind the will of God, ſeeks for ſomthing wiſer, and greater than God himſelf.</p>
            <p>In this redemption then God purſues the devil, in all thoſe ſteps, by which he had made his profit, of a prodigality; for, firſt, as we gave away our ſelves, ſo he reſtores us to our ſelves again. It is well expreſed in the parable of the prodigall;<note place="margin">Luc. 15.</note> and his caſe is ours. The portion which he asked of his father, was the uſe of his free-will. God gave it him; <hi>Adams</hi> firſt Immortality was, <hi>poſſe non mori</hi> he needed not to have died: It was in his own power whether he would keep a free-will, or, no, and he ſpent that ſtock, he loſt that free-will. He ſpent not his free-will ſo as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> underſtands this ſpending, that that man may be ſayd to ſpend his life ill, that miſimployes it, but yet he hath this life in him ſtill: But the prodigall, <hi>Adam,</hi> ſpent is utterly: he ſpent it ſo, that he and we have no freewill at all left. But yet; even the prodigall ſayd, that he would return to his father, and he came; He had not only ſome ſudden thoughts of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:93368:85"/>
but he put himſelf actually in the way: <hi>cum longe abeſſet,</hi> ſays that parable, when he was a great way off, yet becauſe he was in the way, his father met him and kiſſed him, and put that Robe upon him, which was not onely <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitas, quam perdidit Adam,</hi> as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> qualifies it, a reſtitution to the ſame integrity, which <hi>Adam</hi> had and had loſt, but that was <hi>Amictus ſapientiae,</hi> (ſo S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> calls it) it was an ability to preſerve himſelf in that integrity, to which he was reſtored. It was a Robe that was put upon him; it vvas none of his ovvn; but vvhen it vvas put upon him, it rectified and reſtored thoſe faculties, which were his own: as the eye ſees in a man reſtored to life, though the ſoul enable the eye and not the eye it ſelf, ſo the faculty of free-will works in us as well as it did in <hi>Adam</hi> though onely the grace of God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that faculty.</p>
            <p>When God hath wrought that firſt cure (which he does by incorporating us, in the Church by baptiſme) that we are our ſelves again, then (as in the caſe of prodigals in the law) as they had Tutors, and Curators appointed them, ſo he ſends the Holy Ghoſt, to be our Guardian our Curator: and as the office of that perſon, in that law, was double, firſt to reverſe all contracts and bargains, which that prodigal perſon, in that ſtate, had made, and ſecondly to inhibit, and hinder him, from making new contracts, ſo this bleſſed Spirit of conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, by his ſanctification, ſeals to our conſciences a <hi>Quietus eſt,</hi> a diſcharge of all former ſpiritual debts, he cancells all them, he nails them to the croſs of Chriſt, and then he ſtrengthens us againſt relapſes into the ſame ſins again.</p>
            <p>He proceds farther than this; beyond reſtering us, beyond preſerving us; for he betters us, he improves us, to a better condition, than we were in, at firſt. And this he does, firſt by purging and purifying us, and then by changing, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muting us. He purges us by his ſun-ſhine, by his temporal bleſſings; for, as the greateſt globes of gold lye neareſt the face and top of the earth, where they have received the beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction from the heat of the ſun; ſo certainly, in reaſon, they who have had Gods continual ſun-ſhine upon them, in a proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous fortune, ſhould have received the beſt concoction, the beſt digeſtion of the teſtimonies of his love, and conſequently be the purer, and the more refined mettall. If this purging pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail not, then he comes to purge thoſe whom he means to lay up in his treaſure, with tribulation; he carries them from the ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine into the fire, and therefore, if thoſe tribulations fall upon thee in a great and heavy meaſure, think thy droſs needed this vehemence, and do not make afflictions, Arguments of God neglecting thee, for he that is preſented to have ſuffered very
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:93368:85"/>
much, is alſo preſented to have been very righteous, that is <hi>Iob;</hi> And he that was the moſt innocent of all, ſuffered moſt of all, Chriſt Ieſus thy Saviour.</p>
            <p>From this purifying comes our tranſmutation, that we are changed <hi>in ſemen Dei,</hi> made the ſeed of God: for, ſo God calls children that are derived from honeſt, and godly parents,<note place="margin">Mal. 2.</note>

               <note place="margin">1.15.</note> That God ſhould be all in all, ſo as that at laſt, the whole nature of mankind, and indeed, all other natures and ſubſtances (if <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> have been rightly underſtood by ſome men near his own times) ſhould be ſwallowed up, and drowned in the very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of God himſelf. But this tranſmutation is a glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring of Gods image in us, and it is our conformity to him; and when either his temporal bleſſings, or his afflictions, his ſun, or his fire, hath tried us up to that height, to a conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to him, then come we to that tranſmutation, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits no re-tranſmutation, which is a modeſt, but infalible aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of a final perſeverance, ſo to be joyned to the Lord, as to be one ſpirit with him; for as a ſpirit cannot be divided, ſo they who are thus changed into him, are ſo much His, ſo much He, as that nothing can ſeparate them from him; and this is the ladder, by which we may try, how far we are in the way to heaven.</p>
            <p>And when we are come to this, then we are able to ſee, and to conſider, the poverty, and the value of him, who had before bought us, for nothing, and enthraled us.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.</note> The Devil is called the Lord of the world; but that is, in the perſon of Infidells; and we are none of that world.

In devilliſh trading
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:93368:86"/>
there is no paſſing without money: in the Temple it ſelf there were, In the Church, and Church affaires there are buyers, and ſellers too; if there were no buyers there would be no ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers; but there was a third ſort that was whiped out too; which were Changers. But in oure caſe it was God, that was to be ſatisfied; and therefore we were not redeemed with corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table things, as ſilver and gold,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.</note> but with the precious blood of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now this blood of Chriſt Ieſus was not within the Compaſs of this word, which is here tranſlated Money: though, as I noted at the begining, this word <hi>Caſaph</hi> includes all that the heart can wiſh, or deſire: for though the Application of the blood of Chriſt, now that is ſhed is to be wiſhed by every ſinner to his own ſoul, Though the ſheding of that blood might have been wiſhed by the patriarchs, to whom God had revealed, that in the fullneſs of time it ſhould be ſhed, at the ſecond coming of Chriſt, and the Reſurrection may be wiſhed for, by us now, yet, if we take <hi>Rem integram,</hi> if we take the matter at firſt, without any ſuch revealing of Gods purpoſe as he in his Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath afforded us; ſo no man might have wiſhed, or prayed, without a greater ſin in that wiſh and in that prayer than all his former ſins, that the Son of God might come down and dye for his ſins: If it could poſſibly have fallen into his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that this might have been a way for his redemption; yet he ought not to have wiſhed that way: neither might it, neither certainly did it ever fall within the deſire of any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparing ſinner, that thought, that the death of Chriſt appertaind not to him, to wiſh that God the father, or God the Holy Ghoſt, would come down, and become man and ſhed his blood for him. Th blood of Chriſt by which we are redeemed was not this <hi>Caſaph</hi> it was not <hi>Res appetibilis,</hi> a thing that a ſinner might, or could deſire to be ſhed for him, though being ſhed, he muſt deſire, that it may be applied to him. And hence it is that ſome of the fathers argue, that when the Devill began to tempt Chriſt, he knew him not to be the Son of God: for even to the devil himſelf, the blood of Chriſt; could not be <hi>Res appetibilis,</hi> a thing that deliberately he could have deſired ſhould have been ſhed. If the devil had conſidered, that the ſhedding of that blood, would have redeemed us, would he have haſtned the ſhedding of that blood?</p>
            <p>He redeemed us then without money; And as he bought ſo he ſells: He paid no money, he asks no money: but he proclaims freely to all,<note place="margin">Eſa. 55.</note> 
               <hi>Ho every one that thirſteth come to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and ye that have no ſilver, come, buy, and eat; come,</hi> I <hi>ſay, buy wine, and milk, without ſilver, and without money.</hi> But you muſt come; and you muſt come to the market; to the Magazine
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:93368:87"/>
of his graces, his Church; And you muſt buy, though you have no money: he paid obedience, and he asks obedience to himſelf, and his Church, at your hands. And then, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did to his brethren, he will give you your corn, and your money again; he will give you grace, and temporal bleſſings too: he will refreſh and re-eſtabliſh your natural faculties, and give you ſupernatural. He hath already done enough for all, even in his mercy, he was juſt; juſt to the Devil himſelf: for as we had done, ſo he did; he gave himſelf; both to the firſt death, as long as it could hold him, and to the ſecond death, as far as it could reach him. But though all this be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done, yet, to conclude, there is a particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Comfort, in this word, you ſhall be: that though the act of our redemption be paſt the Application is future: and in the elect and regenerate child of God, though his conſcience tells him every day, that he ſels away himſelf, yet his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhall tell him too, he ſhall be redeemed without money, he ſhall not periſh finally: as we cannot carry our thoughts to ſo high a time, but that God elected us, before that, ſo we cannot continue our ſins of infirmity ſo long, but that God will have mercy upon us after that: I cannot name a time, when Gods love began, it is eternal, I cannot imagine a time, when his mercy will end, it is perpetual.</p>

His dangers were from perſons near him, from his Alliance, by marriage, and from his neareſt kindred by blood. <hi>Laban,</hi> into whoſe houſe he had married, made advantages upon him, deluded him, oppreſſed him, purſued him.

in providing againſt the imminent dangers. Firſt then he makes as ſure as he can at home;<note place="margin">ver. 7.</note> He diſpoſes his troops, and his cattel ſo, as that, if his brother ſhould come hoſtilly, he might do leaſt harm. And he provides as well as he could that he ſhould not come hoſtilly, he ſends him preſents, and he ſends him reſpective and ceremonious meſſages. He neglects not the ſtrengthening of him ſelf, that ſo he might make his peace when he were able to ſuſtein a war; he neglects not the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of all occaſions, that might ſubmit him to a war: And in the midſt of theſe two important and neceſſary cares, love of peace, and proviſion for war, his chief recourſe is to God; to him he prays; and he prays to him firſt, as he was (as we may ſay) <hi>Deus familiaris, a God to his family,</hi> and race <hi>O God of my father Abraham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">ver. 9.</note> 
               <hi>and God of my father Iſaac;</hi> and as a God, from whom this familiarity did not take away the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence; for he addes there preſently the great name of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hova,</hi> the Lord he preſent to him his obedience to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, Thou ſaidſt unto me, <hi>Return unto thy Countrey, and to thy kindred,</hi> he preſents to him his confidence in his promiſes, <hi>Thou ſaidſt, I will ſurely do thee good, and make thy ſeed, as the ſand of the ſea;</hi> and upon theſe grounds and inducements, he comes to the formal prayer, <hi>Erue me,</hi> I <hi>pray thee deliver me from the hand of my brother;</hi> and he prayes for others as well as himſelf; for I fear he will ſmite me, and the Mothers upon the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: He ſolicites God for all that are committed to him. And as in the Midſt of danger, he came to preparation, and in the midſt of his preparations, he came to this prayer, ſo in the midſt of this prayer, he comes to this humble and grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full conſideration, that God had been already more bountifull unto him than he could have propoſed to his hopes or to his wiſhes, I <hi>am not worthy of the leaſt of all thy Mercyes and of all the Truth which thou haſt ſhewed unto thy ſervant; for with my ſtaffe</hi> I <hi>paſſed over this</hi> Jordan; <hi>and now</hi> I <hi>am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come two bands.</hi>

I came over <hi>Jordan,</hi> he was forced to leave his Countrey; and he came over it but with a ſtaffe, in a poor and ill provided manner; and with his ſtaffe, no aſſiſtance but his own. And he returns again, ther's his firſt comfort; and he returns now; now that God had ſpoken to him before he ſet out, and now that God had revealed to him an army of Angels in his aſſiſtance, and now that God had increaſed his temporal ſtate ſo far, as that he was become two bands, ſo that though he ſhould looſe much, yet he had much left.</p>
            <p>In benefits that paſs from men of higher ranck, to perſons of lower condition, it is not the way to get them, to ground the requeſt upon our own merit; Merit implies an obligation, that we have laid upon them; and that implies a debt. And a Petition for a due debt is an affront; it is not ſo much a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition delivered as a writ ſerved upon him, to call him to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer his injuſt deteining of a juſt debt. Thus it is amongſt men between whom their may be true merit; but toward God there can be none; and therefore much more there boldneſs to proceed with him upon pretence of merit. <hi>Et de Deo, no tuan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam

No Man was worthy to be biden to the ſupper;<note place="margin">Mat. 22.8.</note> But thoſe that were biden, were not worthy; that invitation made them not worthy. No ſparke of worth in us, before God call us; but that firſt grace of his, doth not preſently make us worthy.

Let every one of us therefore diſſect and cut up himſelf, and conſider what he was before God raiſed him friends to bring thoſe abilities, and good parts, which he had, into knowledge, and into uſe, and into employment; what he was before he had by education, and ſtudy, and induſtry, imprinted thoſe abilities in his ſoul; what he was before that ſoul was infuſed into him, capable of ſuch education; what he was, when he was but in the liſt, and catalogue of creatures, and might have been left in the ſtate of a worm, or a plant, or a ſtone; what he was, when he was not ſo far, but onely in the vaſt and unexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and unimaginable depth, of nothing at all.

That then God took him by the hand, and led him into the Court; that there he held him by the hand, and defended him againſt envy, and practiſe; that he hath clothed him with the opinions of good men; that he hath adorned him with riches, and with titles; let a man ſtand thus, and ruminate, and ſpell over Gods ſeveral bleſſings to him, ſylable by ſylable, and he ſhall not onely ſay,

            <p>And thus it is whether we conſider this goodneſs of God, in <hi>miſerationibus,</hi> In his mercies, or in <hi>veritate,</hi> in his truth.<note place="margin">Miſerationis</note> Not that Gods mercy and truth are ever ſevered; But we take his mercy to be that promiſe, that covenant, which out of his own free goodneſs he was pleaſed to make to man and which is grounded upon nothing, but his own pleaſure, and we take truth, and fidelity, to be the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, and execution of thoſe merciful promiſes, which truth is grounded upon his promiſe. Now for his mercies, firſt, though we ſay as truly as School terms can reach too, <hi>Miſerecordia preſumit miſeriam,</hi> we can conſider no mercy, till ſomething be miſerable, upon whom mercy may work, and ſo cannot properly place mercy in God, before the fall of man in ſuch a reſpect, yet though the work of creation, were not a work of mercy, being intended onely and wholly to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yet to create man, in an ability to glorifie him in that way, and that meaſure as he did, this was a work of mercy, becauſe man had been leſs happy without that ability. So that of this mercy to man, of being dignified above all other creatures, in the contributing to the glory of the Creator, but eſpecially of that mercy of electing certain men, in whom he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that dignity, which others ſhould forfeit, of this general mercy, mankind was not worthy, of this particular mercy theſe particular men were not worthy, for neither theſe men, nor this mankind was then at all, when God had this mercy upon them.</p>
            <p>But for our underſtanding the goodneſs of God,<note place="margin">Veritates.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our own unworthineſs, it appears beſt in the conſideration of his truth, of the performance of theſe his promiſes for, by the ſtrength of his truth, and fidelity in God, is my ſoul raiſed to that, that that which is ordinarily, and naturally the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the conſcience of a ſinner, is the peace of mine, that which is naturally a tempeſt, is my calm, that which is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally a rock to ſhipwrack at, is my Anchor to ride out all foul weather: and that is, the juſtice of God; that which would ſhake, and ſhiver my conſcience, if there were no mercy nor promiſe, ſettles it now becauſe there is a truth, that that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſhall be performed to me.</p>
            <p>Briefly, God was merciful, it was meer mercy in him, to promiſe a Meſſias Chriſt Jeſus, when <hi>Adam</hi> was fallen; but to give him when he had promiſed him, was juſtice, and truth, and fidelity. So that he applies Chriſt Jeſus to me by the working of his bleſſed Spirit, this is meer mercy; but that when Chriſt is thus applied to me, I have peace of conſcience
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:93368:91"/>
and an inchoation of the kingdom of heaven here, this is his <hi>Juſtice, and Truth, and fidelity:</hi> So that the next, and immediate reſting place for my ſalvation, and my peace, is the Juſtice of God. Now, for the expreſſing of his Largeneſs, in exhibiting to us thoſe bleſſings, which belong to this promiſe, It is an uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full conſideration,<note place="margin">Numb. 17.</note> which ariſes out of that miraculous bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the rodds of the Twelve tribes: Gods promiſe goes no farther but that, for that Man whom he would chuſe <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga germinabit:</hi> His rod ſhould bud forth, but when <hi>Moſes;</hi> on the morrow went to loock how his promiſe was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <hi>Levies</hi> rod had budded, and bloſſomed, and born per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect fruit; In his mercys, he exceeds his promiſes; In his judgments he contracts them; as we ſee he contracted Davids peſtilence of three dayes, into leſs than one. He puniſhes to the third, and forth generation; but he ſhewes mercy unto thouſands.<note place="margin">Exod. 20.</note> He gives more than he promiſes; and he does it ſooner;<note place="margin">Chryſ.</note> as <hi>St Chryſoſtome</hi> obſerves: That whereas mans faſhion is to demoliſh and pull down that in one day, which ſpent many monthes in the ſetting up, God diſpatches faſter in his building, and reparation, than in his ruin and diſtruction; He built all the world in ſix dayes, (ſayes he) and when he would deſtroy but one Town, <hi>Jerico,</hi> he imployd Eight; Conſider him then <hi>in Miſerationibus,</hi> in his mercies, or in <hi>veritate</hi> in his truth, and wherein were we worthy of the leaſt of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, or performances.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Expectatio.</note>Now, of theſe mercies grounded upon Gods will, and of theſe truths grounded upon his word, we muſt neceſſarily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge an unworthyneſs in our ſelves, if they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to us, but as expectancies, but as reverſions, that ſhould be had; nay but as poſſibilities, that they might be had:<note place="margin">Aug.</note> for <hi>Perdidimus poſsibilitatem boni;</hi> that's our caſe now; that we have loſt all poſſibility of doing, or receiving any good of our ſelves. In decimations upon popular rebellions, when they tithe men for execution, every man conceives a juſt hope; for it is ten to one he may ſcape with his life. In Lotteries, though the odds be great on the other ſide, every man hopes, he that is never ſo far off in a remainder for land, would be loth to have his name expunged,<note place="margin">Joh. 5.</note> and raced out. He that had been ſick thirty eight years, and could never get into the pool, yet he came ſtill in hope that he ſhould get in at laſt: It is thus in civil and moral things; it is much more ſo in divine; even expectation from God is a degree of fruition. There is no paine in <hi>Davids</hi> expectance <hi>expectam Dominum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 40.2.3.</note> in waiting pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently for the Lord, as long as we know, <hi>Habakkuks veniens veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et Dominus,</hi> becauſe the Lord will ſurely come, ſays he, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he does not tary.

God will ſtay when he comes: when we are ſure that God will come to ſuccour us, to weaken our enemies, That's a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and that's a truth, which we are not worthy of though he be not come yet.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Jacob</hi> conſiders here,<note place="margin">Experientia.</note> and every man may in his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, the mercys, and truths which God had ſhewed him already; neither doth the word which both our tranſlations have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted here, anſwer the original nor reach home.

It is S. <hi>Auguſtins</hi> obſervation, that that land,<note place="margin">Aug.</note> which is ſo often called the land of promiſe, was their land from the beginning, from the beginning <hi>Sem,</hi> of whom they came dwelt there: and though God reſtored them by a miraculous power, to their poſſeſſion, yet ſtill it was a returning: and ſo the bleſſing is ever more expreſſed; a return from <hi>Egypt,</hi> a return from <hi>Babylon;</hi> and a return from their preſent diſperſion is that, which comforts them ſtill, Chriſt himſelf had this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, <hi>clarifica me,</hi> Glorifie me, thou father,<note place="margin">Joh. 17.5.</note> with that glory, which I had with thee before the world was. Certainly our beſt aſſurance of ſalvation, is but a returning to our firſt ſtate, in the decree of God for our election; when we can conſider, our intereſt, in that decree we return. Our beſt ſtate in this life, is but a returning, to the purity, which we had in our baptiſm; whoſoever ſurpriſes himſelf in the act or in the remorſe of any ſin that he is fallen into, would think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a bleſſed ſtate, if he could bring his conſcience to that peace again, which he remembers, he had the laſt time he made up his accounts to God, and had his diſcharge ſealed in the Sacrament of the body and blood of Chriſt Jeſus. Cleanſe thy ſelf often therefore, and accuſtome thy ſoul to that peace, that thou mayeſt ſtill, when thou falleſt into ſin, have ſuch a ſtate in thy memory, as thou mayeſt have a deſire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to: and the Spirit of God ſhall ſtill return to thee,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12.7.</note> who loveſt to receive it, and at laſt thy ſpirit, ſhall return to him that gave it, and gave his own ſpirit for it.</p>

But that hath been Gods abundant, And overflowing goodneſs ever to ſuccor the infirmity of Man, with ſenſible and viſible things; unto the pillars in the Wilderneſs; with the Tabarnacle after; and with the temple and all the Miſterious, and ſignificative furniture thereof after all. So God leaves not <hi>Jacob</hi> to the general knowledge, that the Angels of God protect Gods Children, but he manifeſted thoſe Angels unto him, <hi>Occurrerunt ei.</hi> the Angels of God met him. The word of God is an infalible guid to thee, But God hath provided thee alſo viſible, and manifeſt aſſiſtants, the Pillar, his Church and the Angels his Miniſters in the Church.

The Scripture is thine onely <hi>Ephod,</hi> but <hi>Applica Ephod,</hi> apply it to thee by his Church, and by his viſible Angels, and not by thine own private interpretation.</p>
            <p>This was <hi>Jacobs nunc;</hi> now, when he was returned,<note place="margin">2. Turmae.</note> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Gods Commandement; upon Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment purſued, and teſtified by Angels, and Angels viſibly manifeſted; now, he could take a comfort in the contemplation of his fortune, of his eſtate, to ſee, that he was two bands. Here's a great change; we ſee his vowe; and we ſee how far his wiſhes extended at his going out;<note place="margin">Gen. 28.20</note> 
               <hi>If God will give me bread to eate, and cloathes to put on, ſo that</hi> I <hi>come againe unto my fathers houſe in ſafety, then ſhall the Lord be my God,</hi> In which vow is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded all the ſervice that he could exhibite, or retribute to God. Now his ſtaffe is become a ſword; a ſtrong Army; his one ſtaff now is multiplyed; his wives are given for ſtaffes to aſſiſt him, and his children given alſo for ſtaffes to his age. His own ſtaffe is become the greateſt, and beſt part of <hi>Labans</hi> wealth; In ſuch plenty, as that he could ſpare a preſent to <hi>Eſau,</hi> of at leaſt five hundred head of cattell. The fathers make Morall expoſitions of this; That his two bands are his Tempor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bleſſings and his ſpirituall: And St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> findes a tipicall alluſion in it of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Aug.</note> 
               <hi>Baculo Crucis Chriſtus apprehendit mundum; &amp; cum duabus turmis duobus populis, ad patrem rediit:</hi> Chriſt by his ſtaffe, his Croſs, muſter'd two bands, that is Jews, and Gentiles. We finde enough for our purpoſe, in taking it literally, as we ſee it in the Text; That he divided all his company, and all his cattell into two troups, that if <hi>Eſau</hi> come, and ſmite one, the other might ſcape. For then onely is a fortune full, when there is ſomthing for Leakage, for waſt; when a Man, though he may juſtly fear, that this ſhall be taken from him, yet he may juſtly preſume, that this ſhall be left to him; though he loſe much, yet he ſhall have enough. And this was <hi>Jacobs</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and height; and from this lowneſs; from one ſtaff, to two bands. And therefore, ſince in God we can conſider but one ſtate <hi>Semper idem</hi> immutable; ſince in the Devil, we can conſider but two ſtates <hi>Quomodo cecidit filius Orientis,</hi> that he was the ſon of the Morning, but is, and ſhall ever be for ever the child of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting death; ſince in <hi>Jacob</hi> and in our ſelves we can conſider firſt, that God made man righteous, ſecondly that man betooke himſelf to his one ſtaff, and his own ſtaff, The imaginations of his own heart, Thirdly; That by the word of God manifeſted by his Angels, he returns with two bands, Body and Soul, to his heavenly father againe, let us attribute all to his goodneſs, and confeſſe to him and the world, <hi>That we are not worthy of the leaſt of all his Mercies, and of all the Truth which he hath ſhewed unto his Servant, for with my ſtaff I paſſed over this</hi> Jordan, <hi>and now I am become two bands.</hi>

            <p>THE greateſt part of the body of the old-Teſtament is Prophecy, and that is eſpecially of future things: The greateſt part of the new-Teſtament, if wee number the peeces, is Epiſtles, Relations of things paſt, for inſtruction of the preſent. They erre not much, that call the whol new-Teſtament E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle: For, even the Goſpells are <hi>Evangelia,</hi> good Meſsages, and that's proper to an Epiſtle, and the booke of the Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles is ſuperſcrib'd, by Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> to one Perſon, to <hi>Theophilus,</hi> and that's proper to an Epiſtle; and ſo is the laſt booke, the booke of Revelation, to the ſeverall Churches; and of the reſt there is no queſtion, An Epiſtle is <hi>collucutio ſcripta,</hi> ſaies Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> Though it be written far off, and ſent, yet it is a Conference, and <hi>ſeperatos copulat,</hi> ſayes hee; by this meanes wee overcome diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, we deceive abſences, and wee are together even then when wee are aſunder: And therefore, in this kinde of conveying ſpirituall comfort to their friends, have the ancient Fathers been more exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed then in any other former, almoſt all of them have written Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: One of them, <hi>Iſidorus,</hi> him whom wee call <hi>Peluciotes,</hi> Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s ſchollar is noted to have written Myriades,<note place="margin">Nicephor.</note> and in thoſe Epiſtles, to have interpreted the whole Scriptures: St. <hi>Paul</hi> gave them the example, he writ nothing but in this kind, and in this exceeded all his fellow Apoſtles, <hi>&amp; pateretur</hi> Paulus, <hi>quod</hi> Saulus <hi>ſeceret,</hi> ſaies St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> That as he had asked Letters of Commiſſion of the State to perſecute Chriſtians, ſo by theſe Letters of Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hee might recompence that Church againe, which hee had ſo much damnified before: As the Hebrew Rabbins ſay, That <hi>Rahab</hi> did let down <hi>Jofuah</hi>'s ſpies, out of her houſe, with the ſame cord, with which ſhe had uſed formerly to draw up her adultrous lovers, into her houſe. Now the holy-Ghoſt was in all the Authors, of all the books of the Bible, but in Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, there is, ſayes
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:93368:96"/>
               <hi>Irenaeus, Impetus Spiritus Sancti,</hi> The vehemence, the force of the holy-Ghoſt; And as that vehemence is in all his Epiſtles, ſo <hi>amplius habent, quae e vinculis</hi> (as Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> makes the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation) Thoſe Epiſtles which were written in Priſon, have moſt of this holy vehemence, and this (as that Father notes alſo) is one of them; And of all them, we may juſtly conceive this to be the moſt vehement and forcible, in which he undertakes to inſtruct a Biſhop in his Epiſcopall function, which is, to propagate the Goſpell; for, he is but an ill Biſhop that leaves Chriſt where he found him, in whoſe time the Goſpell is yet no farther then it was; how much worſe is he, in whoſe time the Goſpell loſes ground? who leaves not the Goſpell in ſo good ſtate as he found it. Now of this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, here recommended by <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothie,</hi> this is the Summe; <hi>That Chriſt Jeſus came into the World to ſave Sinners, &amp;c.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Diviſion.</note>Here then we ſhall have theſe three Parts; Firſt <hi>Radicem,</hi> The Roote of the Goſpell, from whence it ſprings; it is <hi>fidelis ſermo,</hi> a faithfull Word, which cannot erre: And ſecondly, we have <hi>Arbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, Corpus;</hi> the Tree, the Body, the ſubſtance of the Goſpell, That <hi>Chriſt Jeſus came into the world to ſave ſinners;</hi> And then laſtly, <hi>fructum Evangelii,</hi> the fruit of the Goſpell, <hi>Humility,</hi> that it brings them who embrace it, to acknowledg themſelves to be the greateſt ſinners, And in the firſt of theſe, the Roote it ſelfe, wee ſhall paſſe by theſe ſteps: Firſt, that it is <hi>Sermo,</hi> the Word; That the Goſpell hath as good a ground as the Law; the new-Teſtament as well founded as the Old; It is the word of God: And then it is <hi>fidelis Sermo,</hi> a faithfull Word: now both Old and New are ſo, and equally ſo; but in this, the Goſpell is <hi>fidelior,</hi> the more faithfull, and the more ſure, becauſe that word, the Law, hath had a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, an expiration, but the Goſpell ſhall never have that. And againe, It is <hi>Sermo omni acceptatione dignus,</hi> Worthy of all acceptation; not only worthy to bee received by our Faith, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by our Reaſon too; our Reaſon cannot hold out againſt the proofes of Chriſtians for their Goſpell: And as the word imports it deſerves <hi>omnem acceptationem,</hi> and <hi>omnem approbationem,</hi> all approbation, and therefore, as wee ſhould not diſpute againſt it, and ſo are bound to accept it, to receive it, not to ſpeake againſt it; ſo neither ſhould wee doe any thing againſt it; as wee are bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it by acknowledgment, ſo wee are bound to approve it, by conforming our ſelves unto it; our conſent to it ſhewes our accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, our life our approbation; and ſo much is in the firſt Part, the Roote; <hi>This is a faithfull Word, and worthy of all acceptation.</hi> And in the Second, the Tree, the Body, the ſubſtance of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell; That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is come into the World to ſave Sinners;</hi> Firſt, here is an <hi>Advent,</hi> a coming of a new Perſon into the World who was not here before, <hi>venit in mundum,</hi> hee came into the World; And ſecondly, hee that came, is firſt Chriſt, a mixt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,

God and Man, and thereby capable of that Office, able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile God and Man; And <hi>Chriſtus</hi> ſo to, a perſon anoynted, appointed, and ſent for that purpoſe, to reconcile God and Man; And then hee is <hi>Jeſus,</hi> one did actually and really doe the office of a Saviour, hee did reconcile God and Man; for, there wee ſee alſo the Reaſon why hee came; Hee came to Save, and whom hee came to Save; to ſave Sinners: And theſe will bee the branches and lymbs of this Body. And then laſtly, when wee come to conſider the fruit, which is indeede the ſeede, and kernell, and ſoul of all virtues <hi>Humility;</hi> then wee ſhall meete the Apoſtle confeſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to bee the greateſt Sinner, not only with a <hi>fui,</hi> that hee was ſo whileſt he was a Perſecutor, but with a preſent <hi>ſum,</hi> that even now, after hee had received the faithfull Word, the light of the Goſpell, yet hee was ſtill the greateſt Sinner; of which <hi>(Sinners)</hi> I (though an <hi>Apoſtle</hi>) am (am ſtill) the chiefeſt,</p>
            <p>Firſt then, the Goſpell is founded and rooted <hi>in ſermone,</hi>

               <hi>in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo,</hi> in the Word; it cannot deſerve <hi>omnem acceptationem,</hi> if it bee not Goſpell, and it is not Goſpell, if it be not <hi>in ſermone,</hi> rooted in the Word: Chriſt himſelfe, as he hath an eternall Generation, is <hi>verbum Dei,</hi> Himſelfe is the Word of God; And as he hath a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Generation, he is <hi>ſubjectum verbi Dei,</hi> the ſubject of the Word of God, of all the Scriptures, of all that was ſhadowed in the Types, and figur'd in the Ceremonies, and prepared in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of the Law, of all that was foretold by the Prophets, of all that the Soule of man rejoyced in, and congratulated with the Spirit of God, in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> and in the cheerefull parts of ſpirituall joy and exultation, which we have in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; Chriſt is the foundation of all thoſe Scriptures, Chriſt is the burden of all thoſe Songs; Chriſt was <hi>in ſermone</hi> then, then he was in the Word. The joy of thoſe holy Perſons which are noted in the Scriptures, to have expreſſed their joy at the byrth of Chriſt, in ſuch ſpirituall Hymns and Songs, is expreſſed ſo, as that we may ſee their joy was in this, That that was now <hi>in actu,</hi> that was performed, that was done which was before <hi>in ſermone,</hi> in the Promiſe, in the Word, in the Covenant of God. They rejoyced that Chriſt was borne; but principally that all was done ſo, <hi>ſicut locutus,</hi> as God had ſpoken before, that all ſhould be done; done of the ſeede of a Woman, as God had ſaid in Paradice, done by a Virgin, as God had ſaid by <hi>Eſai,</hi> done at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> as he had ſaid by <hi>Micheas;</hi> and done at that time, as he had ſaid by <hi>Daniel; Sicut locutus eſt,</hi> ſayes <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charie,</hi> in his exultation, All is performed as he hath ſpoke by the mouth of the Prophets, which have beene ſince the World began. There in the Word, the Goſpell begins, and there, and there only, it ſhall continue for ever, as long as there is any ſpirituall ſeed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> any men willing to embrace it, and apply it, as the bleſſed Virgin expreſſes it, when <hi>her Soul magnifies the Lord, and her Spirit
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:93368:97"/>
rejoyces in God her Saviour; ſicut locutus,</hi> as God hath ſpoken to our Fathers, to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed for ever: ſo then there never was, there never muſt be any other Goſpel then is <hi>in ſermone,</hi> in the written word of God in the Scriptures. The particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that a Chriſtian conceives, as it is determined and contracted in himſelf, is principally in this, that Chriſt is come; his comfort is in this, that he is now ſaved by him; and he might have this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, though Chriſt had never been <hi>in ſermone,</hi> though he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been propheſied, never ſpoken of before: But yet the proof and ground of this comfort to himſelf, that is, the aſſurance that he hath, That this was that Chriſt that was to ſave us; and then, the munition and artillery by which he is to overthrow the forces of the enemy, the arguments and objections of Jews, Gentils and Hereticks, who deny this Chriſt in whoſe ſalvation he truſts, to have then any ſuch Saviour: And then the Band of the Church, the Communion of Saints, by which we ſhould prove, That the Patriarchs and the Apoſtles, our Fathers in the old and new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, doe belong all to one Church; this aſſurance in our ſelf; this ability to prove it to others; this joyning of theſe two walls, to make up the houſhold of the faithfull: This is not only that, that the ſumme of the Goſpel is riſen, in that Chriſt is come, but in this, that he is come <hi>ſicut locutus eſt,</hi> as God had ſpoken of him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him by the mouth of his Prophets from the beginning, as he was <hi>in ſermone,</hi> in the word.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Creation, when God made heaven and earth, that making was not <hi>in ſermone,</hi> for that could not be propheſied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, becauſe there was no being before; neither is it ſaid, that at that Creation God ſaid any thing, but only <hi>creavit, God made hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth,</hi> and no men; ſo that that which was made <hi>ſine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone,</hi> without ſpeaking, was only matter without form, heaven without light, and earth without any productive virtue or diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to bring forth, and to nouriſh creatures. But when God came to thoſe ſpecifique formes, and to thoſe creatures wherein he would be ſenſibly glorified after, they were made <hi>in ſermone,</hi> by his word; <hi>Dixit &amp; facta ſunt,</hi> God ſpake, and ſo all things were made; Light and Firmament, Land and Sea, Plants and Beaſts, and Fiſhes and Fowls were made all <hi>in ſermone,</hi> by his word. But when God came to the beſt of his creatures, to Man, Man was not only made <hi>in verbo,</hi> as the reſt were, by ſpeaking a word, but by a Conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by a Conference, by a Counſell, <hi>faciamus hominem, let us make Man;</hi> there is a more expreſſe manifeſtation of divers perſons ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king together, of a concurrence of the Trinity; and not of a ſaying only, but a mutuall ſaying; not of a Propoſition only, but of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogue in the making of Man: The making of matter alone was <hi>ſine verbo,</hi> without any word at all; the making of leſſer creatures was <hi>in verbo,</hi> by ſaying, by ſpeaking; the making of Man was <hi>in
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:93368:97"/>
in ſermone,</hi> in a conſultation. In this firſt Creation thus preſented there is a ſhadow, a repreſentation of our ſecond Creation, our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation in Chriſt, and of the ſaving knowledge of God; for firſt there is in Man a knowledge of God, <hi>ſine ſermone,</hi> without his word, in the book of Creatures: <hi>Non ſunt loquelae,</hi> ſayes <hi>David,</hi>

               <hi>They have no language, they have no ſpeech, and yet they declare the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God.</hi> The correſpondence and relation of all parts of Nature to one Author, the conſinuity and dependance of every piece and joynt of this frame of the world, the admirable order, the immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſucceſſion, the lively and certain generation, and birth of effects from their Parents, the cauſes: in all theſe, though there be no ſound, no voice, yet we may even ſee that it is an excellent ſong, an admirable piece of muſick and harmony; and that God does (as it were) play upon this Organ in his adminiſtration and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence by naturall means and inſtruments; and ſo there is ſome kind of creation in us, ſome knowledge of God imprinted, <hi>ſine ſermone,</hi> without any relation to his word. But this is a Creation as of heaven and earth, which were dark and empty, and without form, till the Spirit of God moved, and till God ſpoke: Till there came the Spirit, the breath of Gods mouth, the word of God, it is but a faint twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, it is but an uncertain glimmering which we have of God in the Creature: But <hi>in ſermone,</hi> in his word, when we come to him in his Scriptures, we finde better and nobler Creatures produced in us, clearer notions of God, and more evident manifeſtations of his power, and of his goodneſs towards us: for if we conſider him in his firſt word, <hi>ſicut locutus ab initio,</hi> as he ſpoke from the beginning in the Old Teſtament, from thence we cannot only ſee, but feel and apply a <hi>Dixit, fiat lux,</hi> that God hath ſaid, <hi>let there be light;</hi> and that there is a light produced in us, by which we ſee, that this world was not made by chance, for then it could not conſiſt in this order and regularity; and we ſee that it was not eternall, for if it were eternall as God, and ſo no Creature, then it muſt be God too; we ſee it had a beginning, a beginning of nothing, and all from God. So we find in our ſelf a <hi>fiat lux,</hi> that there is ſuch a light produced: And there we may find a <hi>fiat firmamentum,</hi> that there is a kind of firmament produced in us, a knowledge of a difference between Heaven and Earth; and that there is in our conſtitutions an earthly part, a body, and a heavenly part, a ſoul, and an underſtanding as a firmament, to ſeparate, diſtinguiſh and diſcern between theſe. So alſo may we find a <hi>congregenter aquae,</hi> that God hath ſaid, <hi>Let</hi> there be a ſea, a gathering, a confluence of all ſuch means as are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the attaining of ſalvation; that is, that God from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning ſettled and eſtabliſhed a Church, in which he was alwayes carefull to miniſter to man means of eternall happineſs: The Church is that Sea, and into that Sea we launched the water of Baptiſm. To contract this <hi>ſine ſermone,</hi> till God ſpake, in his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:93368:98"/>
only, we have but a faint and uncertain, and generall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God: <hi>in ſermone,</hi> when God comes to ſpeak at firſt in the Old Teſtament, though he come to more particulars, yet it was in dark ſpeeches, and in vails, and to them who underſtood beſt, and ſaw cleareſt into Gods word; ſtill it was but <hi>de futuro,</hi> by way of promiſe, and of a future thing. But when God comes to his laſt work, to make Man, to make up Man, that is, to make Man a Chriſtian by the Goſpel, when he comes not to a <hi>fiat homo, Let there be a Man</hi> (as he proceeded in the reſt) but to a <hi>faciamus homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, Let us make Man:</hi> Then he calls his Sonne to him, and ſends him into the world to ſuffer death, the death of the Croſſe for our ſalvation: And he calls the Holy Ghoſt to him, and ſends him to teach us all truth, and apply that which Chriſt ſuffered for our ſouls, to our ſouls. God leaves the Nations, the Gentiles, under the <hi>non locutus eſt;</hi> he ſpeaks not at all to them, but in the ſpeechleſs creatures: He leaves the Jewes under the <hi>locutus eſt,</hi> under the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling letter of the Law, and their ſtubborn perverting thereof: And he comes to us, <hi>ſicut locutus eſt,</hi> in manifeſting to us that our Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias, Chriſt Jeſus, is come, and come according to the promiſe of God, and the foretelling of all his Prophets; for that is our ſafe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chorage in all ſtorms, that our Goſpel is <hi>in ſermone</hi> that all things are done, ſo as God had foretold they ſhould be done; that we have infallible marks given us before, by which we may try all that is done after.</p>
            <p>All the word of God then conduces to the Goſpel; the Old Teſtament is a preparation and a poedagogie to the New. All the word belongs to the Goſpell, and all the Goſpell is in the word; nothing is to be obtruded to our faith as neceſſary to ſalvation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be rooted in the Word. And as the <hi>locutus eſt,</hi> that is, the promiſes that God hath made to us in the Old Teſtament; and the <hi>ſicut locutus eſt,</hi> that is, the accompliſhing of thoſe promiſes to us in the New-Teſtament, are thus applyable to us; ſo is this eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, <hi>Quod adhuc loquitur,</hi> that God continues his ſpeech, and ſpeaks to us every day; ſtill we muſt hear <hi>Evangelium in ſermone,</hi> the Goſpel in the Word, in the Word ſo as we may hear it, that is, the Word preached; for howſoever it be Goſpel in it ſelf, it is not Goſpel to us if it be not preached in the Congregation; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though it be preached to the Congregation, is it Goſpel to me, except I find it work upon my underſtanding and my faith, and my conſcience: A man may believe that there ſhall be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and he may give an Hiſtoricall aſſent, that there hath been a Redeemer, that that Redeemer is come, he may have heard <hi>utrumque ſermonem,</hi> both Gods wayes of ſpeaking, both his voices, both his languages; his promiſes in the Old Teſtament, his perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances in the New Teſtament, and yet not hear him ſpeak to his own ſoul: <hi>Ferme Apoſtoli plus laborarunt,</hi> ſays S. <hi>Chryſ.</hi> It coſt the

Apoſtles, and their Succeſſors, the preachers of the Goſpell, more paines and more labour, <hi>ut perſuaderent hominibus, dona Dei iis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulta,</hi> To perſwade men that this mercy of God, and theſe merits of Chriſt Jeſus were intended to them, and directed upon them, in particular, then to perſwade them that ſuch things were done: they can beleeve the promiſe, and the performance in the generall, but they cannot finde the application thereof in particular; the voice that is neereſt us we leaſt heare, not becauſe God ſpeaks not loud e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, but becauſe we ſtop our eares; nor that neyther; for wee doe hear, but becauſe we do not hearken then, nor conſider; no nor that neyther, but becauſe we doe not anſwere, nor cooperate, nor aſſiſt God, in doing that which he hath made us able to doe, by his grace towards our own Salvation. For (not to judge <hi>De iis qui foris ſunt</hi>) of thoſe whom God hath left (fot any thing we know) in the darke, and without meanes of Salvation, becauſe without manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt; we are Chriſtians incorporated in Chriſt in his Church; and thereby, by that Title, we have a new Creation, and are new creatures; and as wee ſhall have a new Jeruſalem here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, ſo we have a new Paradiſe already, which is the Chriſtian Church. In this Paradiſe ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine, Quatuor Evangelia ligna fructifera;</hi> In the books of the Goſpell, as they grow, and as they are ſuplicated in the Church, growes every Tree plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant for the ſight, and good for meat: And there, ſayes that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>lignum vitae Chriſtus,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus himſelf (as he is taught hee that gives life to all our actions; and even ſo our faith it ſelf, which faith qualifies and dignifies thoſe actions: And then, ſayes from the Scriptures, in the Church) is the Tree of Life, for it is he, As Chriſt alone, in this Paradiſe, that is, the chriſtian Church, is this Tree of life, ſo <hi>lignum ſcientiae boni &amp; mali,</hi> The Tree of knowledg of Good and Evill, is <hi>Proprium voluntatis arbitrium,</hi> the good uſe of our own Will, after God hath enlightned us in this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, in the Chriſtian Church, and ſo reſtor'd our dead will again, by his Grace precedent and ſubſequent, and concommitant: for, without ſuch Grace and ſuch ſucceſſion of Grace, our Will is ſo far unable to pre-diſpoſe it ſelfe to any good, as that <hi>nec ſcipſo, homo, niſi pernicioſe uti poteſt</hi> (ſayes he ſtill) we have no intereſt in our ſelves no power to doe any thing of, or with our ſelves, but to our deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Miſerable man! a Toad is a bag of Poyſon, and a Spider is a bliſter of Poyſon, and yet a Toad and a Spider cannot poyſon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; Man hath a dram of poyſon, originall-Sin, in an inviſible corner, we know not where, and he cannot chooſe but poyſon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and all his actions with that; we are ſo far from being able to begin without Grace, as then where we have the firſt Grace, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not proceed to the uſe of that, without more. But yet, ſayes Saint <hi>Auguſtine;</hi> The Will of a Chriſtian ſo rectified and ſo aſſiſted, the <hi>lignum ſcientiae,</hi> the Tree of knowledge, and he ſhall be the worſe

for knowing, if he live not according to that knowledg; we were all wrapped up in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> all Mankind; and we are wrapped up in the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> in Chriſt, all Mankinde too; but not in both alike; for we are ſo in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> as that we inherit death from him, and incurre death whether we will or no; before any conſent of ours be actually given to any Sin, we are the children of wrath, and of death; but we are not ſo in the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> as that we are made poſſeſſors of eternall life, without the concurrence of our own Will; not that our will payes one penny towards this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, but our own will may forfeit it; it cannot adopt us, but it may diſinherit us. Now, by being planted in this Paradiſe, and received into the Chriſtian Church, we are the adopted ſons of God, and therefore, as it is in Chriſt, who is the naturall Son of God, <hi>Qui non naſcitur &amp; deſinit,</hi> as <hi>Origen</hi> expreſſes it, He was not born once and no more, but hath a continual, becauſe an eternall generation, and is as much begotten to day, as he was 100. 1000. 1000 millions of generations paſſed; ſo ſince we are the generation and of-ſpring of God, ſince Grace is our Father, that Parent that begets all goodneſs in us, <hi>In ſimilitudine ejus,</hi> ſayes <hi>Origen,</hi> conformable to the Pattern Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Qui non naſcitur &amp; deſinit,</hi> who hath a continuall generation, <hi>Generemur Domino per ſingulos intellectus, &amp; ſingula o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pera,</hi> in all the acts of our underſtanding, and in a ready concurrence of our Will, let us every day, every minute feele this new generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſpirituall children; for it is a miſerable ſhort life, to have been borne when the glaſſe was turned, and dyed before it was run out: to have conceived ſome good Motions at the beginning, and to have given over all purpoſe of practiſe at the end of a Sermon. Let us pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent our own will as a mother to the father of light, and the father of life, and the father of love, that we may be willing to conceive by the overſhadowing of the Holy Ghoſt, and not reſiſt his working upon our Soules; but with the obedience of the bleſſed Virgin, may ſay, <hi>Ecce ancilla,</hi> Behold the ſeruant of the Lord, <hi>fiat mihi ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum verbum tuum,</hi> Be it done unto me according to thy Word; I will not ſtop mine eares to thy Word, my heart ſhall not doubt of thy word, my life ſhall expreſſe my having heard and harkened to thy word, that word which is the Goſpell, that Goſpell which is peace to my Conſcience, and reconciliation to my God, and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to my Soul; for, hearing is but the conception, meditation is but the quickning, purpoſing is but the byrth, but practiſing is the growth of this bleſſed childe.</p>

This is a faithfull ſaying.</hi> It is true, that this Apoſtle ſeemes to uſe this phraſe of ſpeech, as an earneſt aſſeveration, and a band for divers truths in other places: He ſaies ſometimes, <hi>This is a true ſaying,</hi> and <hi>This is a faithfull ſaying,</hi> when he does not meane, that it is the word of God, but only intends to induce a morall certitude, when he would have good credit to be given to that which followes, he uſes to ſay ſo, <hi>fidelis ſermo,</hi> it is a true, <hi>it is a faithfull ſaying:</hi> But in all thoſe other places where he uſes this phraſe, he ſpeaks only of ſome particular duties, or of ſome particular point of Religion; but here he ſpeaks of the whole body of Divinity, of the whol Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, <hi>That Chriſt is come to ſave Sinners,</hi> and therefore more may be intended by this phraſe here, then in other places: When hee ſpeaks of that particular point, <hi>The Reſurrection,</hi> he uſes this phraſe, <hi>It is a true ſaying; If we be dead with him we ſhall alſo live with him;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.11.</note> when he would invite men to godlineſſe, even by the reward which accompany it in this life, he uſes this addition, this confirmation, <hi>For this is a true ſaying, and worthy to bee received;</hi>

               <hi>That they which have beleeved in God, might be carefull to ſhew forth good works.</hi> Till he have found faith, and beleefe in God, he never calls upon good works, he never calls them good; but when we have Faith, he would not have us ſtop nor determine there, but proceed to works too. It is a phraſe which the Apoſtle does frequently, and almoſt proverbially uſe in theſe many places, but in all theſe places, upon particular and leſſer occaſions; but here, preparing the doctrine of the whole Goſpell, this phraſe admits a larger extent, That as it is grounded upon the Word, that is, we muſt have ſomthing to ſhew for it; ſo it is upon a faithfull word, upon that which is cleerly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the encumbrance of diſputation, the infallible word of God; no traditionall word, no apocryphall word, but the cleere and faithfull word. Now of all the attributes, of all the qualities that can be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the word of God, this is moſt proper to it ſelfe, and moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable, and moſt comfortable to us, that it is <hi>fidelis,</hi> a faithfull word; For, this being a word that hath principally reſpect and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the fidelity of God, it implies neceſſarily a Covenant, a Contract with us, which God hath bound himſelfe faithfully to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form unto us; and therefore God calls his Covenant with <hi>David</hi> by this name, <hi>fideles miſerecordias David, An everlaſting Covenant,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſai. 55.3 15.11.</note> 
               <hi>even the ſure mercies of</hi> David. And when the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended a feare that God would breake that Covenant which hee had made with that Nation, which had broken with him, he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:93368:100"/>
that paſſion in a word, contrary to this, and imputes out of his haſty feare, even infidelity to God, <hi>Why art thou unto mee</hi> (ſayes hee there) <hi>as a Lyar, &amp; ſicut aquae infideles,</hi> as unfaithfull water, that I cannot truſt to; or <hi>Aquae mendaces,</hi> as it is in the Originall, lying waters, deceitfull waters, that promiſe a continuance and doe not perform it? Why doſt thou pretend to make a Covenant with thy people and wilt not perform it faithfully? Moſt of Gods other attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes are accompanied with this in the Scriptures, whatſoever God is called beſides, he is called <hi>fidelis,</hi> faithfull too. In one place he is <hi>fortis &amp; fidelis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 7 9.</note> he is powerfull; but if he turne his power vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively upon me, I were better if he were leſſe powerfull; but he hath made a Covenant with me, that he will turn his power upon thoſe whom he hath called his Enemies, becauſe they are mine, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in lies my comfort, that he is a powerfull and a faithfull God. In a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place,<note place="margin">Eſay. 49 7.</note> he is <hi>fidelis &amp; ſanctus;</hi> he is a holy God; but if he be ſo, and but ſo, how ſhall I, who am unholy, ſtand in his ſight? He hath made a Covenant with me, that as they who look'd upon the Serpent in the Wilderneſſe, ſhed and caſt out the venom of that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent who had ſtung them before; ſo when I look'd faithfully upon my Saviour, all my unholineſſe falls off as rags, and I ſhall be inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in his Righteouſneſſe, in his Holyneſſe; and ſo in that lies my comfort, that he is a Holy and a Faithfull God. Howſoever wee conſider God in the Schools, in his other attributes, yet here is my Univerſity and my Chair, here I muſt take my Degree, in my Heart, in my Conſcience; and this is that that brings God home, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies him cloſs to me, that he is <hi>fidelis,</hi> a faithfull God; that in his mercy he hath made a Covenant with us, and in his faithfulneſſe hee will performe it. And therefore conſider God in his firſt great worke,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.19.</note> his Creation, ſo he is <hi>fidelis Creator,</hi> let them that ſuffer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of God, commit their Souls to him in well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as unto a faithfull Creator. He had gracious purpoſes upon us in our Creation, and he is faithfull to his purpoſes; and ſo this faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full God is God the Father.

not to conſider it in a Church whoſe dores are ſhut up againſt any of us, ſo as that we can have no Repentance, no abſolution; God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, we are not to conſider God in thoſe Decrees, wherein we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſider him as <hi>fidelem Deum;</hi> In thoſe Decrees, which are not revealed to us, we know not whether he be faithfull, or no; for we know not what his promiſe, what his purpoſe was: But as he hath manifeſted himſelf in his Word, as he hath made a conditionall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract with us, ſo as that if we performe our part, he will performe his, and not otherwiſe; ſo we may be ſure that he is <hi>fidelis Deus,</hi> a God that will ſtand to his word, a God that will performe his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes faithfully; for, though it were meerly his Mercy, that made thoſe promiſes, yet it is his fidelity, his Truth, his faithfulneſſe, that binds him to the performance of them.<note place="margin">Pſal. 31.4.

And then, as when he compares Scripture with the booke of Creatures and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he finds that evidence more forcible then the other; and when he finds this Scripture compared with other pretended Scriptures, Alcaron or Talmud, he finds it to be of infinite power above them; ſo when he comes to the true Scriptures, and compares the new-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament with the Old, the Goſpel with the Law, he finds this to be a performance of thoſe promiſes, a fullfiling of thoſe Prophecies, a revelation of thoſe Types and Figures and an accompliſhment, and a poſſeſſion of thoſe hopes and thoſe reverſions; And when hee comes to that argument which works moſt forcibly, and moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily upon man's reaſon, which is <hi>Antiquiſtrum,</hi> That's beſt in matter of Religion that was firſt, there he ſees the Goſpell was before the Law:<note place="margin">Gal. 3.17.</note> This I ſay, ſayes the Apoſtle, that the Law, which was four hundred thirty yeers after, cannot diſannull the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which was confirmed of God in reſpect of Chriſt; ſo ſhall alwaies in reſpect of faith and in reſpect of Reaſon, <hi>It is worthy of acceptation;</hi> for, would thy Soule expatiate in that large contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God in generall?<note place="margin">Rom. 1.1.</note> It is <hi>Evangelium Dei,</hi> the Goſpell of God: wouldſt thou contract this God into a narrower &amp; more diſcernable ſtation?<note place="margin">Mar. 1.1.</note> It is <hi>Evangelium Jeſu Chriſti,</hi> the Goſpell of Jeſus Chriſt: wouldſt thou draw it neerer to the conſideration of the effects?

                  <p>This is a faithfull ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, That <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> came into the World to ſave Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; of which I am the chiefeſt.</p>

            <p>WE have conſidered heretofore that which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the Roote, and all the circumſtances thereof. That which belongs to the <hi>Tree it ſelfe,</hi> what this <hi>acceptable Goſpell is, That Chriſt Jeſus came into the World, to ſave Sinners;</hi> and then, that which appertains to the fruit of this Goſpell, the Humility of the Apoſtle, in applying it to himſelfe, <hi>Quorum ego, Of which Sinners I am the chiefeſt,</hi> were reſerved for this time. In the firſt of theſe, that which we call the Tree, the Body of this Goſpell, there are three branches; firſt an <hi>Advent,</hi> A coming; and ſecondly, the <hi>Perſon that came;</hi> and Laſtly, the <hi>worke</hi> for which he came. And in the firſt of theſe, we ſhall make theſe ſteps; Firſt, that it is a new coming of a Perſon who was not here before, at leaſt, not in that manner as he comes now, <hi>venit,</hi> He came; And Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that this coming is in Act, not only in Decree; ſo he was come and ſlaine <hi>ab initio,</hi> from all eternity, in God's purpoſe of our Salvation; nor come only in promiſe, ſo he came wrapped up in the firſt promiſe of a Meſſiah; in Paradiſe, in that <hi>ipſe conteret, He ſhall bruiſe the Serpents head;</hi> nor come only in the often renuing of that promiſe to <hi>Abraham, in ſemine tuo, In thy ſeed ſhall all Nations be bleſſed,</hi> nor only in the ratification and refreſhing of that promiſe to <hi>Judah, Donec Silo, Till Silo come;</hi> and to <hi>David, in Solio tuo, The Scepter ſhall not depart;</hi> nor as he came in the Prophets, <hi>in I ſays virgo concipiet,</hi> That he ſhould come of a virgin, nor in <hi>Michaeas, Et tu Bethlem,</hi> That he ſhould come out of that Towne; but this is a Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoricall, not a Propheticall, an Actuall not a Promiſſary coming; it is a coming already executed; <hi>venit,</hi> he came, he is come. And then Thirdly, <hi>venit in mundum, He came into the World,</hi> into the whole World, ſo that by his purpoſe firſt extends to all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the World, and then it ſhall extend to thee in particular, who art a part of this world; He is come into the world, and into
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:93368:102"/>
thee. From hence, we ſhall deſcend to our ſecond branch, to the conſiderations of the perſon that comes; and he is, firſt <hi>Chriſtus,</hi> in which one name we find firſt his capacity to reconcile God and man, becauſe he is a mixt perſon, uniting both in himſelf; and we find alſo his Commiſſion to work this Reconciliation, becauſe he is <hi>Chriſtus,</hi> an annointed perſon, appointed by that unction, to that purpoſe; And thirdly, we find him to be Jeſus, that is, actually a Saviour; that as we had firſt his capacity and his Commiſſion in the name of Chriſt, ſo we might have the execution of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in the name of Jeſus. And then laſtly, in the laſt branch of this part, we ſhall ſee the work it ſelf, <hi>Venit ſalvare,</hi> He came to ſave; It is not <hi>offerre,</hi> to offer it to them whom he did intend it to, but he came really and truly to ſave; It was not to ſhow a land of promiſe to <hi>Moyſes,</hi> &amp; then ſay, there it is, but thou ſhalt never come at it; It was not to ſhew us ſalvation, &amp; then ſay there it is, in Baptiſm it is, in Preaching, and in the other Sacrament, it is; but ſoft, there is a Decree of predeſtination againſt thee, and thou ſhalt have none of it; But <hi>venit ſalvare,</hi> He came to ſave; And whom? Sinners. Thoſe, who the more they ackowledg themſelves to be ſo, the nearer they are to this ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Firſt then for the <hi>Advent,</hi> this comming of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Part 1.</note> we have a Rule reaſonable general in the ſchool, <hi>Miſsio in divinis eſt novo modo operatio,</hi> Then is any perſon of the Trinity ſaid to be ſent, or to come, when they work in any place, or in any perſon in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner or meaſure then they did before; yet that Rule doth not reach home, to the expreſſing of all commings of the perſons of the Trinity: The ſecond perſon came more pretentially then ſo, more then in an extraordinary working and Energie, and execution of his power, if it be rightly apprehended by thoſe Fathers, who in many of thoſe Angels which appear'd to the Patriarcks, and whoſe ſervice God us'd in delivering Iſrael out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them the Law in <hi>Sinai,</hi> to be the ſon of God himſelf to have been preſent, and many things to have been attributed to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in thoſe hiſtories, which were done by the ſon of God, not only working, but preſent in that place, at that time. So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Holy Ghoſt came more preſentially then ſo, more then by an extraordinary extention of his power, when he came preſentially and perſonally in the Dove, to ſeal <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm upon Chriſt. But yet, though thoſe pretential commings of Chriſt as an Angel in the old Teſtament, and this comming of the Holy Ghoſt in a Dove in the New, were more then ordinary commings, and more then extraordinary workings too, yet they were all far ſhort of this comming of the ſon of God in this Text: for it could never be ſaid properly in any of thoſe caſes, That that or that Angel, was the ſon of God, the ſecond perſon, or that that Dove was the Holy Ghoſt, or the third perſon of the Trinity; but in this <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,</hi>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:93368:103"/>
which we have in hand here, it is truly and properly ſaid, this man is God, this ſon of <hi>Mary</hi> is the ſon of God, this Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſon, is that very God that made the world. He came ſo to us, as that he became us, not only by a new and more powerful working in us, but by aſſuming our nature upon himſelf.</p>
            <p>It is a perplex't queſtion in the School, (and truly the Balance in thoſe of the middle age, very even) whether if <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinned, the ſon of God had come into the world, and taken our nature and our fleſh upon him. Out of the infinite teſtimonies of the abundant love of God to man many concluded, that howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, though <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinned, God would have dignified the nature of man in the higheſt degree, that that nature was any ways capable off: and ſince it appears now, (becauſe that hath been done) that the nature of man was capable of ſuch aſſuming, by the Son of God, they argue, that God would have done this though <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinn'd. He had not come, ſay they, <hi>ut medicus,</hi> if man had not contracted that infections ſickneſs by <hi>Adams</hi> ſin; Chriſt had not come in the nature of a Phyſitian, to recover him; <hi>non ut Redemptor</hi> ſay they, If man had not forfeited his intereſt and ſtate in heaven by <hi>Adams</hi> ſin; Chriſt had not come in the nature of a Redeemer, but <hi>ut frater, ut Dominus, ad nobilitandum genus humanus,</hi> out of a brotherly love, and out of a royal favour, to exalt that nature which he did love, to impart and convey to us a greater and nobler ſtate, then we had in our Creation: in ſuch a reſpect, and to ſuch a purpoſe, he ſhould have come. But ſince they themſelves who follow that opinion come to ſay, That that is the more ſubtle opinion, and the more agreable to mans reaſon, (becauſe man willingly embraces, and purſues any thing that conduces to the dignifying of his own nature) but that the other opinion, that Chriſt had not come, if our ſins had not occaſioned his comming, is <hi>magis conformis ſcripturis &amp; magis hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat Deum,</hi> is more agreable to the Scriptures, and derives more honor upon God: we cannot err, if we keep with the Scriptures, and in the way that leads to Gods glory, and ſo ſay with St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt. Si homo non periiſſet, filius hominis non veniſſet,</hi> If man could have been ſav'd otherwiſe, the ſon of God had not come in this manner: ot if that may be interpreted of his comming to ſuffer on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we may enlarge it with <hi>Leo, Creatura non fieret qui Creator mundi,</hi> He who was Creator of the world, had never become a Creature in the world, if our ſins had not drawn him to it. It is uſefully ſaid by <hi>Aquinus, Deus ordinavit futura, ut futura erant:</hi> God hath appointed all future things to be, but to be ſo as they are, that is, neceſſary things neceſſarily, and contingent things contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently; abſolute things abſolutely, and conditional things conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally; He hath decreed my ſalvation, but that ſalvation in Chriſt; He had decreed Chriſts comming into this world, but a comming
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:93368:103"/>
to ſave ſinners. And therefore it is a frivolous interogatory, a loſt queſtion, an impertinent article, to enquire what God would have done if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood. But <hi>Adam</hi> is fallen, and we in him; and therefore though we may piouſly wiſh what St. <hi>Auguſtine, utinam non fuiſſet miſeria ne iſte miſericordia eſſet neceſſaria,</hi> I would man had not been ſo miſerable, as to put God to this way of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; yet ſince our ſins had induced this miſery upon us, and this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity (if we may ſo ſay) upon God, let us change all our diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation into thankſgiving, and all our <hi>utrums,</hi> and <hi>quaeres,</hi> and <hi>quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do's</hi> of the ſchool, to the <hi>Benedictus,</hi> and <hi>Alelujahs</hi> and <hi>Oſanna's</hi> of the Church; Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, who hath viſited and redeemed his people; bleſſed that he would come at all, which was our firſt, and bleſſed that he is come already, which is our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond conſideration; <hi>venit,</hi> He came, He is come.<note place="margin">Venit.</note>
            </p>
            <p>As in the former branch the Gentils the Heathens are our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, they deny the <hi>venit,</hi> that a Meſſias is to come at all; ſo in this, the Jews are our enemies, they confeſs the <hi>veniet,</hi> a future com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, but they deny the <hi>venit</hi> that this Meſſias come yet. In that language in which God ſpoke to man there is ſuch aſſurance intimated, that whatſoever God promiſes ſhall be performed; that in that language ordinarily in the Prophets, the times are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and when God is intended to purpoſe or to promiſe any thing in the future, it is very often expreſſed in the time paſt; that which God means to do, he is ſaid to have done; future, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and paſt is all one with God: But yet to man it is much more, that Chriſt is come, then that he would come; not but that they who apprehended faithfully his future comming, had the ſame ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation as we, but they could not ſo eaſily apprehend it as we: God did not preſent ſo many handles to take hold of him in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that he would come, as in the performance, that he was come. They had moſt of theſe handles that liv'd with him, and ſaw him, and heard him; but we that come after, have more then they which were before them, we have more in the hiſtory then they had in the Prophets.</p>
            <p>It was time for him to come in the beginning of the world, for the Devil was a murderer from the beginning.<note place="margin">Joh. 8 44.</note> As the Devil was <hi>felo de ſe,</hi> a murderer of himſelf; as he killed himſelf Chriſt gave him over; he never came to him in that line, he never pardoned him that ſin: but as he practis'd upon man, Chriſt met with him from the beginning: He ſav'd us from his killing, by dying himſelf for us; for being dead, &amp; having taken us into his wounds, and being riſen, and having taken us into his glory; if we be dead in Chriſt already, the Devil cannot kill us, if we be riſen in Chriſt the Devil cannot hold us: And ſo he was <hi>Agnus occiſus ab origine mundi,</hi> the Lamb ſlain from the beginning of the world, that is, as ſoon as the world had any beginning in the purpoſe of God. God ſaw from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:93368:104"/>
that man would need Chriſt, and as ſoon as there was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd an <hi>ego occido,</hi> I will kill, in the Devils mouth, then was an <hi>ego vivificabo,</hi> I will raiſe from death in Gods mouth; and ſo, there was an early comming from all eternity; for he is the Ruler of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, ſaies the Prophet,<note place="margin">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch. 5.2.</note> and his goings forth have been from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and from everlaſting: it is goings in the plural; Chriſt hath divers goings forth, divers commings, &amp; all from the beginning; not only from <hi>Moſes</hi> his <hi>In principio,</hi> which was the beginning of the Creation, (for then alſo Chriſt came in the promiſe of a Meſſiah) but from St. <hi>Johns In principio,</hi> that beginning which was without beginning, the eternal beginning, for there Chriſt came in that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal decree, that he ſhould come. Neither is this only as he is <hi>Germen Jehovae,</hi> the bud of Jehovah, iſſuing from him as his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Son,<note place="margin">Eſa. 4 2.</note> but as the Prophet <hi>Michaeas</hi> ſaies in that place, cited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is, as he ſhall come out of <hi>Bethlem,</hi> and as he ſhall be a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of Iſrael: ſo as he came in our humane nature, as he came to dye for us, as he came to eſtabliſh a Church, ſo his comming is from all eternity for all this was wrapped up in a decree of his coming: And therefore we are not carried upon the conſideration of any decree, or if any means of ſalvation higher or precedent to the comming of Chriſt, for that were to antidate eternity it ſelf.</p>
            <p>So then this coming in the Text, is the execution of that coming in the decree, which is involv'd in St. <hi>Johns In principio,</hi> and it is the performance of it coming, which was enwrapped in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, in <hi>Moſes In principio,</hi>
               <note place="margin">10.24.</note> it is his actual coming in our fleſh: that coming of which Chriſt ſaid in St. <hi>Luke</hi> many Prophets and Kings;<note place="margin">13.17.</note> and in St. <hi>Matth.</hi> many Prophets and righteous men, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſee theſe things which you ſee, and have not ſeen them: the prophets who in their very name were <hi>videntes,</hi> ſeen, ſaw not this comining thus;<note place="margin">Joh. 8.56.</note> 
               <hi>your Father Abraham, rejoyced to ſee my day</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>and he ſaw it, and was glad.</hi> All times and all Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations before time was were Chriſts day; but yet he cals this coming in the fleſh eſpecially his day, becauſe this day was a holy Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctial, and made the day of the Jews and the day of the Gentiles equal; and <hi>Teſtamenta copulat,</hi> ſaies St. <hi>Chriſoſtome,</hi> it binds up the two Teſtaments into one Bible; for if the Partriarks had not deſired to ſee this day, and had not ſeen it in the ſtrength of faith, they and we had not been of one communion. We have a moſt ſure word of the Prophet,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.19.</note> ſaies the Apoſtle, and to that we do well that we take heed; but how far? <hi>As unto a light that ſhineth in a dark place, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the day dawn, and the day ſtar ariſe in your hearts.</hi> But now ſince this coming,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1.2.</note>

Heaven was but a reverſion to them, and it is no more to us; but to them it was a reverſion, as after a Grandfather, and father; two lives, two comings of Chriſt before they would come to their ſtate; Chriſt muſt come firſt in the fleſh, and he muſt come again to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. To us, and in our caſe one of theſe lives is ſpent; Chriſt is come in the fleſh: and therefore as the earth is warmer an hour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſun ſets, then it was an hour before the ſun roſe, ſo let our faith and zeal be warmer now after Chriſt departing out of this world, then theirs was before his coming into it: and let us ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce at this <hi>Ecce venit Rex tuus,</hi> that our King our Miſſias is already come, as that we may cherefully ſay, <hi>veni Domine Jeſu,</hi> come Lord Jeſu come quickly, and be glad if at the going out of theſe dores, we might meet him coming in the clouds.<note place="margin">In Mundum</note>

            <p>Thus far then he hath proceeded already, <hi>venit</hi> He came, and <hi>venit in mundum,</hi> He came into the world; it is not <hi>in mundam,</hi> into ſo clean a woman as had no ſin at all, none contracted from her Parents, no original ſin; for ſo Chriſt had placed his favours and his honors ill, if he had favoured her moſt who had no need of him: to dye for all the world, and not for his mother, or to dye for her, when ſhe needed not that hell, is a ſtrange imagination: ſhe was not without ſin; for then why ſhould ſhe have died? for even a natural death in all that come by natural generation, is of ſin: But certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as ſhe was a veſſel reſerved to receive Chriſt Jeſus, ſo ſhe was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved according to the beſt capacity of that nature, from great and infections ſins. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> was a holy veſſel after Chriſt had thrown the Divel out of her; the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was much more ſo, into whom no reigning power of the Devil ever entred; in ſuch an acceptation then Chriſt came <hi>per mundam in mundum,</hi> by a clean woman into an unclean world. And he came in a purpoſe, as we do piouſly believe) to manifeſt himſelf in the Chriſtian Religion to all the nations of the world; and therefore, <hi>laetentur Inſulae,</hi> ſaies <hi>David, The Lord reigneth let the Iſland rejoyce</hi> the Iſland who by reaſon of their ſituation, proviſion and trading, have moſt means of conveying Chriſt Jeſus over the world.

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:93368:106"/>
which expreſſes it; and that great Minter of Latine words <hi>Tertullian</hi> doth ſo often call by the name of <hi>ſalutificator:</hi> for Jeſus is ſo; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a bringer, an applier, a worker of our ſalvation, but he is the author of the very decree of our ſalvation, as well as of the execution of that Decree: there was no ſalvation before him, there was no ſalvation intended in the book of Life, but in him; yea, no Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marian can clear it, whether this name Jeſus ſignifie <hi>ſalvatorem</hi> or <hi>ſalutem,</hi> the Inſtrument that ſaves us, or the ſalvation that is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded us; for it is not only his perſon, but it is his very righteouſneſs that ſaves us.

            <p>
               <note place="margin">1.21.</note>It may ſeem ſtrange that when St. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaies, That <hi>Mary</hi> was to bring forth a child and call his name Jeſus, He ſaies alſo that this was done that the Prophecy of <hi>Eſai</hi> might be fulfilled, who ſaid, That a virgin ſhall bring forth a child, &amp; who ſhalbe called <hi>Emanuel;</hi> to fulfil a prophecy, of being called <hi>Emanuel,</hi> he muſt be called Jeſus.

               <hi>I ſought</hi> Ephraim <hi>to go,;</hi> we are not able to go, to riſe, to move without him; But how did he teach him?

Them he came to call by the power of Miracles when he lived upon earth, and them he ſtaies to call by the power of his word, now he is aſcended into heaven; for as a furnace needs not the ſame meaſure and proportion of fire to keep it boiling, as it did to heat it; but yet it doth need the ſame fire, that is, fire of the ſame nature, (for the heat of the Sun will not keep it boiling how hot ſoever,) ſo the Church of God needs not miracles now it is eſtabliſhed; but ſtill there is the ſame fire, the working of the ſame ſpirit to ſave ſinners: for that was the end of miracles, and it is the end of preaching, to make men capable of ſalvation by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging themſelves to be ſinners. And this hath brought us to the laſt part of this text, that which at firſt we called the fruit of the Goſpel, Humility.<note place="margin">Third part.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This brought St. <hi>Paul</hi> to be of that <hi>Quorum, Quorum ego maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> not only to diſcern and confeſs himſelf to be a ſinner, but the cheifeſt and greateſt ſinner of all. <hi>Nihil humilitate ſublimius;</hi> it is excellently, but ſtrangely ſaid by St. <hi>Hierome;</hi> He might rather and more credibly have us'd any word then that: He might have been eaſily believed if he had ſaid, <hi>nihil ſapientius,</hi> there is no wiſer thing then humility, for he that is low in his own, ſhall be high in the eyes of others; and to have ſaid <hi>nihil perfective,</hi> there is not ſo direct a way to perfection as humility: But <hi>nihil ſublimius,</hi> muſt needs ſeem ſtrangely ſaid, there is nothing higher then lowneſs; no ſuch exaltation as dejection; no ſuch revenge as patience; and yet all this is truly and ſafely ſaid, with that limitation which St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> gives it there, <hi>apud Deum,</hi> in the ſight of God, there is no ſuch exaltation as humiliation. We muſt not coaſt and croſs the neareſt way, and ſo think to meet Chriſt in his end, which was glory, but we muſt go after him in all his ſteps, in the way of humiliation; for Chriſts very deſcent was a degree of exaltation; and by that name he called his crucifying a lifting up, an exaltation. The Doctrine of this world goes for the moſt part otherwiſe; here we ſay, lay hold, upon ſomething, get up one ſtep; in all want of ſufficiency, in all defection of friends, in all changes, yet the place which you hold which raiſe you to better. In the way to heaven, the lower you go, the nearer the higheſt and beſt end you are. <hi>Duo nobis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaria</hi> ſaies St. <hi>Auguſt. Ut cognoſcamus quales ad malum, quales ad bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num:</hi> There are but two things neceſſary to us to know, how ill we are, and how good we may be; where nature hath left us, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Grace would carry us. And <hi>Abraham,</hi> (ſaies that Father.) expreſſes this two fold knowledg, when he ſaid to God, <hi>Loquar ad Dominum, qui pulvis ſum &amp; cinis,</hi> I know I am but duſt and aſhes,<note place="margin">Gen. 18.</note> ſaies <hi>Abraham,</hi> and there is his firſt knowledg <hi>Qualis ad molum,</hi>

how ill a condition naturally he is in: but then, <hi>Loquar ad Dominum,</hi> for all this, though I be but duſt and aſhes, I have acceſs to my God, and may ſpeak to him; ther's his improvement and his dignity. <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re pulvis omnis homo;</hi> ſaies he; truly every man is truly duſt; for as duſt is blown from one to another corner by the wind, and lies dead there till another wind remove it from that corners; ſo are we hurried from ſin to ſin, and have no motion in our ſelves, but as a new ſin imprints it in us: ſo <hi>vere pulvis,</hi> for our diſpoſition to evil we are truly duſt; and <hi>vere cinis,</hi> we are truly dry aſhes; for aſhes produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth no ſeed of it ſelf, nor gives growth to any ſeed that is caſt into it; ſo we have no good in us naturally, neither can we nouriſh any good that is inſus'd by God into us, except the ſame Grace that ſow'd it; water it, and weed it, and cheriſh it, and ſo ment it after. To know that we have no ſtrength of our ſelves, and to know that we can lack none if we ask it of God, theſe are St. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> two Arts and Sciences, and this is the humility of the Goſpel in general.</p>

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:93368:108"/>
the greateſt ſinner, why ſhould we, or how can we charge the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſo heavily? Beloved, to maintain the truth of this which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaies, we need not ſay that it was materially true, that it was indeed ſo; it is enough to defend it from falſhood, that it was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally true, that is, that it appeard to him to be true, and not out of a ſodain and ſtupid inconſideration but deliberately: Firſt, he reſpected his own natural diſpoſition, and proclivity to great ſins, and out of that evidence condemned himſelf: As when a man who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed an art of judging the diſpoſition of a man by his face, had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced of <hi>Socrates,</hi> (whoſe virtue all the world admir'd) that he was the moſt incontinent and licentious man, the greateſt theif and extortioner of any man in the world; the people deſpiſ'd and ſcorned the Phyſiognomer and his art, and were ready to offer violence unto him: <hi>Socrates</hi> himſelf corrected their diſtemper again, and ſaid, It is true that he ſaies, &amp; his Judgment is well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for by nature no man is more inclined to theſe vices then I am. And this diſpoſition to the greateſt ſins, St. <hi>Paul</hi> knew in himſelf. He that hath theſe natural diſpoſitions is likely to be the greateſt ſinner, except he have ſome ſtrong aſſiſtance to reſtrain him: and then, he that hath the offer of ſuch helps, and abuſes them, is in a farther ſtep of being the greateſt ſinner: And this alſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> had reſpect to now, that he had had a good and learned e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, a good underſtanding of the law and the Prophets, a good mortification, by being of the ſtrict ſect of the Phariſees; and yet he had turned all the wrong way, and was therefore in this abuſe of theſe manifold graces the greater ſinner. He look'd farther then into his own nature, or into his reſiſtance of aſiſtances; he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into thoſe actions which theſe had produc'd in him, and there he ſaw his breathing of threatnings and ſlaugher againſt the Diſciples of the Lord, his hunger and thirſt of chriſtian blood: and ſo ſaies St. <hi>Auguſtine, Nemo acrior inter perſecutores, ergo nemo prior inter peccatores,</hi> as he found himſelf the greateſt perſecutor, ſo he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns himſelf for the greateſt ſinner. But all theſe natural diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to great ſins, negliences, of helps offer'd, ſinful actions produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced out of theſe two, might be greater in many others, then in St. <hi>Paul;</hi> &amp; it is likely, &amp; it may be certain to us, that they were ſo; but it was not certain to him, he knew not ſo much ill by any other man, as by himſelf. Conſider thoſe words in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">30.2.</note> 
               <hi>Surely I am more fooliſh then any man, and have not the underſtanding of a man in me:</hi> for though they be not the words of <hi>Salomon,</hi> yet they are the words of a Prophet, and a Prophet who ſurely was not really more fooliſh then any man, then in conſideration of ſomething which he found in himſelf, ſaies ſo: he that conſiders himſelf, ſhall find ſuch degrees of ſin, as that he cannot ſee than any man hath gone lower: Or if he have in ſome particular and notorious ſin, yet in <hi>quovis alio, quid occultum eſſe poteſt; quo nobis ſuperior ſit:</hi>

then thus in ſome ſin, yet may be above thee in Grace; he may have done a greater ſin, &amp; yet not be the greater ſinner: another hath killed a man, and thou haſt not; thon mayſt have drawn and drunk the blood of many by uſury, by extortion, by oppreſſion. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in fury of intemperance, hath raviſhed and thou haſt not; thou maiſt have corrupted many by thy deceitful ſolicitations; and then in thy ſelf art as ill as the raviſher, and thou haſt made them worſe whom thou haſt corrupted.

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Sum.</note>St. <hi>Paul</hi> does ſo here; yea then, when he ſaw his own caſe, and ſaw it by the light of the ſpirit of God; when he took knowledg that Chriſt was come, and had ſav'd ſinners, had ſav'd him; yet ſtill he ſaies <hi>ſum primus,</hi> ſtill he remains in his accuſation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that he was ſtill the greateſt ſinner, becauſe he remained ſtill in his infirmity, and aptneſs to relapſe into former ſins. As long as we are, we are ſubject to be worſe then we are; and thoſe ſins which we apprehend even with horror and amazement, when we hear that others have done them, we may come to do them with an earneſtneſs, with a delight, with a defence, with a glory, if God leaves us to our ſelves. As long as that is true of us, <hi>ſum prmus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi> I am no better then the firſt man, then <hi>Adam</hi> was, (and none of us are in any proportion ſo good) that is true alſo, <hi>Quorum pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus ſum ego,</hi> I am ſtill in a ſlippery ſtate, and in an evident dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being the greateſt ſinner. This is the concluſion for every humble chriſtian, no man is a greater ſinner then I was, and I am not ſure but that I may fall to be worſe then ever I was, except I husband and imploy the Talents of Gods Graces better then I have done.</p>

            <p>HE that will dy with Chriſt upon Good-Friday, muſt hear his own bell toll all Lent; he that will be partaker of his paſſion at laſt, muſt conform himſelf to his diſcipline of prayer &amp; faſting before. Is there any man, that in his chamber hears a bell toll for another man, and does not kneel down to pray for that dying man? and then when his charity breaths out upon another man, does he not alſo reflect upon himſelf, and diſpoſe himſelf as if he were in the ſtate of that dying man? We begin to hear Chriſts bell toll now, and is not our bell in the chime? We muſt be in his grave, before we come to his reſurrection, and we muſt be in his death-bed before we come to his grave: we muſt do as he did, faſt and pray, before we can ſay as he ſaid, that <hi>In manus tuas,</hi> Into thy hands O Lord I commend my Spirit. You would not go into a Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Bath without ſome preparatives; preſume not upon that Bath, the blood of Chriſt Jeſus, in the Sacrament then, without prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives neither. Neither ſay to your ſelves, we ſhall have preparatives enough, warnings enough, many more Sermons before it come to that, and ſo it is too ſoon yet; you are not ſure you ſhall have more; not ſure you ſhall have all this; not ſure you ſhall be affected with any. If you be, when you are, remember that as in that good Cuſtome in theſe Cities, you hear cheerful ſtreet muſick in the winter mornings, but yet there was a ſad and doleful bel-man, that wak'd you, and call'd upon you two or three hours before that mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick came; ſo for all that bleſſed muſick which the ſervants of God ſhall preſent to you in this place, it may be of uſe, that a poor bell-man wak'd you before, and though but by his noyſe, prepared you for their muſick. And for this early office I take Chriſts earlieſt witneſs, his Proto-Martyr, his firſt witneſs St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> and in him that which eſpecially made him his witneſs, and our example, his his death, and our preparation to death, what he ſuffered, what he did, what he ſaid, ſo far as is knit up in thoſe words, <hi>When he had ſaid this, he fell a ſleep.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:93368:110"/>From which example, I humbly offer to you theſe two general conſiderations; firſt, that every man is bound to do ſomething be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dye; and then to that man who hath done thoſe things which the duties of his calling bind him to, death is but a ſleep. In the firſt, we ſhall ſtop upon each of thoſe ſteps; firſt there is a <hi>ſis aliquid,</hi> every man is bound to be ſomething, to take ſome calling upon him. Secondly there is a <hi>hoc age;</hi> every man is bound to do ſeriouſly and ſcedulouſly, and ſincerely the duties of that calling. And Thirdly there is a <hi>ſis aliquis;</hi> the better to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme thoſe duties, every man ſhall do well to propoſe to himſelf ſome perſon, ſome pattern, ſome example whom he will follow and imitate in that calling. In which third branch of this firſt part we ſhall have juſt occaſion to conſider ſome particulars in him who is here propos'd for our Example, St. <hi>Stephen;</hi> and in theſe three, <hi>ſis aliquid,</hi> be ſomething, profeſs ſomething; and then <hi>hoc age,</hi> do tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the duties of that profeſſion; and laſtly, <hi>ſis aliquis,</hi> propoſe ſome good man, in that profeſſion to to follow, and in the things intended in this text, propoſe St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> we ſhall determine our firſt part. And in the other we ſhall ſee that to them that do not this, that do not ſettle their conſciences ſo, death is a bloody conflict, and no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory at laſt, a tempeſtuous ſea, and do harbor at laſt, a ſlippery heighth, and no footing, a deſperate fall and no bottom. But then to them that have done it, their pill is gilded, and the body of the pill hony too; <hi>mors lucrum,</hi> death is a gain, a treaſure, and this treaſure brought ſome in a calm too; they do not only go to heaven by death, but heaven comes to them in death; their very manner of dying is an inchoative act of their glorified ſtate: therefore it is not call'd a dying but aſſeeping; which one metaphor intimates two bleſſings, that becauſe it is a ſleep it gives a preſent reſt, and becauſe it is a ſleep, it promiſes a future waking in the reſurrection.</p>

               <note place="margin">Job. 5 7.</note> God never meant leſs then labor to any man.

For, when new names are given to men in the Scriptures, that doth not aboliſh or extinguiſh the old: <hi>Jacob</hi> was called <hi>Jacob</hi> after God had called him <hi>Iſrael;</hi> &amp; <hi>Gedeon Gedeon</hi> after he was called <hi>Jerubaal</hi> and <hi>Simon</hi> when he was <hi>Peter</hi> too, was called <hi>Simon.</hi> Changes of Office and additions of Honour muſt not extinguiſh our Chriſtian, Name; The duties of our Chriſtianity, and our Religion muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderate and weigh down the duties of all other places, and for all together. Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> preſents us a good uſe of this diligence to anſwere our Names, <hi>Quo quis timet magis, ne quod dicitur non eſſet, eo plus quam dicitur erit;</hi> The more a man is afraid that hee is not

worthy of the name hee beares, whether the name of office or his Chriſtian-Name, the better Officer and the better Chriſtian he will be for that feare, and that ſolicitude; and therefore it is an uſefull and an applyable Prayer for great Perſons, which that Father makes in their behalfe, <hi>Praeſta, quaeſumus Domine, ut quod in ore hominum ſumus, in conſpectu tuo eſſe valeamus:</hi> Grant, O Lord, that wee may alwayes be ſuch in thine eyes, as wee are in their tongues that depend upon us, and juſtifie their acclamations with thy approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And ſo far <hi>Stephens</hi> name, as his name ſignifies the Law, and as his name ſignifies the reward of fulfilling the Law; a Crown hath carried us to the conſideration of the duty of anſwering the ſignification of our names; But then there are other paſſages in his Hiſtory and Actions that carries us farther.</p>
            <p>Firſt then we receive Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> to have been Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the fleſh, and to have been his fellow pupill under <hi>Gamaliel,</hi>

Men of the beſt extraction and families, Men of the beſt parts and faculties, Men of the beſt education and proficiencies, owe themſelves to God by moſt obligations. Him that dyes to day, God ſhall not only aske, where is that Soule? Is it as cleane as I made it at firſt? No ſtayn of Sin? or is it as clean as I waſh'd it in Baptiſme? No ſting? No venome of original ſinne in it? Or is it as clean as I left it when wee met laſt at the Sacrament? No guiltineſſe of actuall ſinne in it? God ſhall not only aske this, Where is that Soul? Nor only aske where is that Body? Is it come back in that Virginal integrity in which I made it? Or is it no farther departed from that then Marriage, which I made for it, hath made it? Are thoſe <hi>Maritales ineptiae</hi> (that we may put <hi>Luther</hi>'s words into God's mouth) the worſt that is faln upon that body? God ſhall not only ask for that Soul and that Body but aske alſo, Where is that Wit, that Learning, thoſe Arts, thoſe languages which by ſo good education I afforded thee? Truly when a weake and ignorant man departs into any vicious way, though in that caſe he doe adhere to the Enemy, and doe ſerve the Devill againſt God, yet he carries away but a ſingle Man, and ſerves

but as a common Souldier: But he that hath good parts, and good education, carries a Regiment in his perſon, and Armies and muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a thouſand in himſelf. Though then thy kinſmen in the fleſh, and thy fellow pupils under <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> men whom thou haſt accompanied heretofore in other waies, think thy preſent fear of God, but a childiſhneſs and puſilanimity, and thy preſent zeal to his ſervice but an infatuation, and a melancholy and thy preſent appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of thy ſelf to God in prayer, but an argument of thy Court-diſpaire, and of thy falling from former hopes there; yet come thou early, if it be early yet; and if it be not early, come apace to Chriſt Jeſus: how learned ſoever thou art, thou art yet to learn thy firſt letters, if thou know not that Chriſt Jeſus is <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> he in whom thou muſt begin and determine every purpoſe: Thou haſt ſtudied thy ſelf but into a dark and damnable ignorance, if thou have labored for much learning only to prove that thou canſt not be ſav'd, only to diſpute againſt the perſon and the Goſpel of Chriſt Jeſus.

But yet howſoever the ſtronger opinion even in that Church lead the other way, and the form of giving that office by impoſition of hands, and the many and great capacities that they receive, that they receive it, carry it to a great heighth, yet the uſe that we make of it here ſhall be but this, that even <hi>Stephen,</hi> who might have been <hi>inter Doctores,</hi> Doctor, (as <hi>Chryſologus</hi> ſaies of him) a Doctor to teach Doctors; and <hi>inter Apoſtolos Apoſtolus,</hi> an Apoſtole to lead Apoſtles, contented himſelf with a lower degree in the ſervice of Chriſt in his Church, the ſervice of a Deacon, which very name ſignifies ſervice, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation.

               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.9.</note> Kings and Prieſts too, yet let us accept the name, and execute the office of Deacon, of miniſtration, eſpecially upon our ſelves: for as every man is a world in himſelf, ſo every man is a Church in himſelf too: and in the ancient Church, it was a part of the Deacons office, to call out to the Church, to the Congregation, <hi>Nequis contra aliquem, nequis in Hipocriſi;</hi> let no man come hither to Church, (indeed no whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for every place, becauſe God is preſent in every place, is a Church,) either in uncharitableneſs towards others, or in Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie &amp; in diſſimulation in himſelf: Bring alwaies a charitable opinion towards other men, and ſincere affections in thy ſelf, and thou haſt done the right office of a Deacon, upon the right ſubject thou hadſt miniſtred to thine own Soul. But then the height of <hi>Stephens</hi> exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plarineſs, (which is the conſideration that we purſue in this branch of this firſt part) is not ſo much in his active as in his paſſive part; not ſo much in that he did, as in that he ſuffered; not as he anſwered &amp; diſcharged the duties of his name; ſo we have propoſed him to you; nor as he was an early Diſciple, and came to Chriſt betimes, we have propoſed him ſo too; nor as he made his ambition only to ſerve Chriſt, and not to ſerve him in a high place, but only as a Deacon; for in that line alſo we have propoſed him to you; But as he was a conſtant and chearful Martyr, and laid down his life for Chriſt, and in that qualification propoſe him to your ſelves, and follow him as a Martyr.</p>

ſtory and Martyrologes of the Church, there are (I think) more Martyrs of this name, <hi>Stephen,</hi> then of any other Name; indeed they have all that Name, for the Name is a Coronation.

For to ſuffer for God, man to ſuffer for God, I to ſuffer for my Maker, for my Redeemer is ſuch a thing, as no ſuch thing, excepting only Gods ſufferings for man can fall into the conſideration of man.

In which words of our Saviour, as we ſee the dignity and reward of Martyrdome, ſo we ſee the extent and latitude, and compaſs of Martyrdome too; that not only loſs of life, but loſs of that which we love in this life; not only the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of death, but the ſuffering of Croſſes in our life, contracts the Name, and entitles us to the reward of Martyrdome. All Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is not a <hi>Smithfeild</hi> Martyrdome, to burn for religion. To ſuffer injuries, and upon advantages offerd, not to revenge thoſe injuries is a Court Martyrdome. To reſiſt outward tentations from power, and inward tentations from affections; in matter of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, between party and party, is a <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Martyrdome. To ſeem no richer then they are, not to make their ſtates better, when they make their private bargains with one another, and to ſeem ſo rich, as they are, and not to make their ſtates worſe, when they are call'd upon to contribute to publick ſervices, this is an Exchange-Martyrdome.

Though I give my body to be burned and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing ſaies the Apoſtle; but if I have not charity I ſhall not be admitted to that Sacrifice, to give my body to be burnt.

            <p>Many have wondred at that note of Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s,<note place="margin">Mors Piorum.</note> That till Chriſt's time death was called death, plainly, literally death, but
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:93368:116"/>
after Chriſt, death was called but ſleepe; for, indeede, in the old-Teſtament before Chriſt, I thinke there is no one metaphor ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten uſed, as Sleepe for Death, and that the Dead are ſaid to Sleepe: Therefore wee wonder ſometimes, that Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſhould ſay ſo: But this may be that which that holy Father intended in that Note, that they in the old-Teſtament, who are ſaid to have ſlept in Death, are ſuch as then, by Faith, did apprehend, and were fixed upon Chriſt; ſuch as were all the good men of the old-Teſtament, and ſo there will not bee many inſtances againſt Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>'s note, That to thoſe that die in Chriſt, Death is but a Sleepe; to all others, Death is Death, literally Death. Now of this dying Man, that dies in Chriſt, that dies the Death of the Righteous, that embraces Death as a Sleepe, muſt wee give you a Picture too.</p>
            <p>These is not a minute left to do it; not a minutes ſand; Is there a minutes patience? Bee pleaſed to remember that thoſe Pictures which are deliver'd in a minute, from a print upon a paper, had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes, weeks, Moneths time for the graving of thoſe Pictures in the Copper; So this Picture of that dying Man, that dies in Chriſt, that dies the death of the Righteous, that embraces Death as a Sleepe, was graving all his life; All his publique actions were the lights, and all his private the ſhadowes of this Picture. And when this Picture comes to the Preſſe, this Man to the ſtreights and agonies of Death, thus he lies, thus he looks, this he is. His un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and his will is all one faculty; He underſtands Gods purpoſe upon him, and he would not have God's purpoſe turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other way; hee ſees God will diſſolve him, and he would faine be diſſolved, to be with Chriſt; His underſtanding and his will is all one faculty; His memory and his fore-ſight ate fixt, and concentred upon one object, upon goodneſſe; Hee remembers that hee hath proceeded in the ſinceritie of a good Conſcience in all the wayes of his calling, and he foreſees that his good name ſhall have the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and his Poſterity the ſupport of the good men of this world; His ſickneſſe ſhall be but a fomentation to ſupple and open his Body for the iſſuing of his Soule; and his Soule ſhall goe forth, not as one that gave over his houſe, but as one that travelled to ſee and learne better Architecture, and meant to returne and re-edifie that houſe, according to thoſe better Rules: And as thoſe thoughts which poſſeſſe us moſt awake, meete us againe when we are aſleepe; So his holy-thoughts, having been alwaies converſant upon the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of his family, the education of his Children, the diſcharge of his place, the ſafety of the State, the happineſſe of the King all his life; when he is faln a ſleepe in Death, all his Dreames in that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sleepe, all his devotions in heaven ſhall be upon the ſame Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and he ſhal ſolicite him that ſits upon the Throne, &amp; the Lamb, God for Chriſt Jeſus ſake, to bleſſe all theſe with his particular
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:93368:116"/>
bleſſings: for, ſo God giveth his beloved ſleep, ſo as that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the next world and aſſiſt this.</p>
            <p>So then, the Death of the Righteous is a ſleepe; firſt,<note place="margin">Pſ. 127.2. <hi>Somnus.</hi>
               </note> as it deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers them to a preſent reſt. Now men ſleepe not well faſting; Nor does a faſting Conſcience, a Conſcience that is not nouriſh'd with a Teſtimony of having done well, come to this Sleepe;<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 5.11.</note> but <hi>dulcis ſomnus operanti,</hi> The ſleepe of a labouring man is ſweete. To him that laboureth in his calling, even this ſleepe of Death is welcome. <hi>When thou lyeſt downe thou ſhalt not be afraid,</hi> ſaith <hi>Salomon;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 3.24.</note> when thy Phyſician ſayes, Sir, you muſt keepe your bed, thou ſhalt not be afraid of that ſick-bed; And then it followes, <hi>And thy ſleepe ſhall be ſweet unto thee;</hi> Thy ſickneſſe welcome, and thy death too; for, in thoſe two <hi>David</hi> ſeems to involve all,<note place="margin">Pſ. 4.8.</note> 
               <hi>I will both lay me downe in Peace, and ſleep;</hi> imbrace patiently my death-bed and Death it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>So then this death is a ſleepe, as it delivers us to a preſent Reſt;<note place="margin">Expergeſacti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">Jer. 51.39.</note> 
               <hi>and they ſhall ſleepe a perpetuall ſleepe and not awake;</hi> They ſhall have no part in the <hi>Second Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> But for them rhat have ſlept in Chriſt, as Chriſt ſayd of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> Lazarus <hi>Sleepeth, but I goe that I may wake him out of ſleep,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jo. 11.11.</note> he ſhall ſay to his father; Let me goe that I may wake them who have ſlept ſo long in expectation of my coming:<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4.14.</note> And <hi>Thoſe that ſleep in Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>will God bring with him;</hi> not only fetch them out of the duſt when he comes, but bring them with him, that is, declare that they have beene in his hands ever ſince they departed out of this world. They ſhall awake as <hi>Jacob</hi> did, and ſay as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid, <hi>Surely the Lord is in this place,</hi> and <hi>this is no other but the houſe of God, and the gate of heaven,</hi> And into that gate they ſhall enter, and in that houſe they ſhall dwell, where there ſhall be no Cloud nor Sun, no darkeneſſe nor dazling, but one equall light, no noyſe nor ſilence, but one equall muſick, no fears nor hopes, but one equal poſſeſſion, no foes nor friends, but and equall communion and Identity, no ends nor beginnings; but one equall eternity. Keepe us Lord ſo awake in the duties of our Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, that we may thus ſleepe in thy Peace, and wake in thy glory, and change that infallibility which thou affordeſt us here, to an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall and undeterminable poſſeſſion of that Kingdome which thy Sonne our Saviour Chriſt Jeſus hath purchaſed for us, with the in-eſtimable price of his incorruptible Blood.</p>

            <p>I Have ſeen minute glaſſes; glaſſes ſo ſhort liv'd: if I were to preach upon this text to ſuch a glaſs, it were enough for half the Sermon; enough to ſhow the worldly man his Treaſure, and the object of his heart, <hi>(For where your Treaſure is, there will your heart be alſo)</hi> to call his eye to that minute glaſs, and to tell him there flows, there flies your treaſure and your heart with it; but if I had a ſecular glaſs, a glaſs that would run an age; if the two Heme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphears of the world were compoſed in the form of ſuch a glaſs, and all the world calcin'd and burnt to aſhes, and all the aſhes and ſands, and atoms of the world put into that glaſs, it would not be enough to tell the godly man who this treaſure and the object of his heart is, a Parot or a Stare, docil a birds, and of pregnant imitation, will ſooner be brought to relate to us the wiſedome of a Council table, then any <hi>Ambroſe</hi> or any <hi>Chriſoſtome,</hi> men that have gold and hony in their Names, ſhall tell us what the ſweetneſs, what the treaſure of heaven is, and what that mans peace that hath ſet his heart upon that treaſure. As nature hath given us certain Elements, and all bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are compoſed of them, and art hath given us a certain Alphabet of letters, and all words are compoſed of them, ſo our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in theſe three Chapters of this Goſpel hath given us a Sermon of texts, of which all our Sermons may be compoſed, all the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of our Religion, all the Canons of our Church, all the injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of our Princes, all the Homilies of our Fathers, all the body of Divinity is in theſe three Chapters, in this one Sermon in the mount; where, as the Preacher concludes his Sermon with exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to practiſe,<note place="margin">7.24.</note> 
               <hi>(whoſoever heareth theſe ſayings of mine and does them,)</hi> ſo he fortifies his Sermon with his own practiſe (which is a bleſſed and powerful method,) for as ſoon as he came out of the pulpit,<note place="margin">8.1.</note> as ſoon as he came down from the mount, he cured the firſt Leper he ſaw, and that without all vain glory, for he forbad him to tell any man of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:93368:117"/>Of this noble body of Divinity one fair limb is in this text; <hi>where your treaſure is there will your heart be alſo.</hi> Imediately before our bleſſed Saviour had forbidden us the laying up of treaſure in this world, upon this reaſon, that here moths and ruſt corrupt,<note place="margin">Diviſio.</note> and theeves break in and ſteal, there the reaſon is, becauſe the money may be loſt; but here in our text it is, becauſe the man may be loſt, <hi>for where your treaſure is, there will your heart be alſo;</hi> ſo that this is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent to that,<note place="margin">Mat. 15.26.</note> 
               <hi>what profit to gain the whole world and loſe a mans own ſoul.</hi> Our text therefore ſtands as that proverbial, that Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glifical letter <hi>Pithagoras</hi> his (y) that hath firſt a ſtalk, a ſtem to fix it ſelf, and then ſpreads into two beams. The ſtem, the ſtalk of this letter, this (y) is in the firſt word of the text, that particle of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, for take heed where you place your treaſure; for it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes you much where your heart be placed; and where your trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is, there your heart will be alſo; and then opens this Symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical, this Catechiſtical letter, this (y) into two hornes, two beams, two branches: One broader, but on the left hand denoting the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this world; the other narrower, but on the right hand, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure laid up for the world co come, be ſure ye turn the right way, <hi>for where your treaſure is, there will your heart be alſo;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt we bind our ſelves to the ſtake, to the ſtalk, to the ſtaffe,<note place="margin">Cor fixum.</note> the ſtem of this Simbolical letter, &amp; conſider in it, that firmneſs &amp; fixa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the heart which God requires; God requires no unatural thing at mans hand; whatſoever God requires of man, man may find imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his own nature, written in his own heart. This firmneſs then, this fixation of the heart is natural to man; every man does ſet his heart upon ſomething, and Chriſt in this place does not ſo much call upon him that he would do ſo, ſet his heart upon ſomething, as to be ſure he ſet it upon the right object; and yet truly even this firſt work to recollect our ſelves, to recapitulate our ſelves, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble and muſter our ſelves, and to bend our hearts intirely and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſly, directly, earneſtly, emphatically, energetically upon ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, is by reaſon of the various fluctuation of our corrupt nature, and the infinite multiplicity of objects, ſuch a work as man needs to be called upon and excited to do it; therefore is there no words in the Scripture ſo often added to the heart, as that of Intireneſs, <hi>Toto corde, omni corde, pleno corde,</hi> do this withal thy heart, with a whole heart, with a full heart; for whatſoever is indiviſible, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable; a Point, becauſe it cannot be denied, cannot be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; the Center, the Poles, God himſelf, becauſe he is indiviſible is therfore immoveable; and when the heart of man is knit up in ſuch an intirenes upon one object, as that it does not flatter nor ſubdivide it ſelf, then, and then only is it fixed. And thats the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in which <hi>David</hi> fixes himſelf; not in his <hi>Cor paratim, my heart is preparad O God, my heart is prepared,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 57 7.</note> (for ſo it may be prepared even by God himſelf, and yet ſcattered and ſubdivided by
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:93368:118"/>
us) But in his <hi>Cor fixum; My heart is fixed O God my heart is fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, awake my glory, awake my Pſaltery and Harp, I my ſelf will awake early,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal 108 1.</note> 
               <hi>and praiſe thee O Lord among the people:</hi> A triumph that <hi>David</hi> returned to more then once, for he repeats the ſame words, with the ſame pathetical earneſtneſs again; ſo that his glory, his victory, his triumph, his peace, his acquieſcence, his al-ſufficiency in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, conſiſted in this, that his heart was fixed; for this fixation of the heart argued and teſtified an intireneſs in it; when God ſaies, <hi>ſili da mihi Cor,</hi> my Son give me thy heart, God means the whole man;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.17.</note> though the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The eye is not the man, nor the ear is not the man;</hi> he does not ſay the heart is not the man; the heart is the man; the heart is all. And as <hi>Moſes</hi> was not ſatisfied with that Commiſſion that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> offered him,<note place="margin">Exod. 10 8.</note> that all the men might go to offer Sacrifice; but <hi>Moſes</hi> would have all their young and all their old, all their Sons and all their Daughters, all their flocks and all their heards, he would have all; ſo when God ſaies, <hi>Fili da mihi cor,</hi> my Son give me thy heart, God will not be ſatisfied with the eye, if I contemplate him in his works, (for thats but the godlineſs of the natural man) nor ſatisfied with the ear, with hearing many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; (for thats but a new invention, a new way of making beads, as if the Papiſt think all done if he have ſaid ſo many Aves, I think all done, If I have heard ſo many Sermons) But God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the heart, the whole man, all the faculties of that man; for only that that is entire, and indiviſible is immoveable; and that that God cals for and we ſeek for, in this ſtem of <hi>Pitha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> his Symbolical letter, is this immoveableneſs, this fixation of the heart; and yet even againſt this, though it be natural, there are many impediments; we ſhall reduce them to a few; to three; theſe three, Firſt, there is <hi>Cor nullum,</hi> a meer heartleſneſs, no heart at all, incogitancy, inconſideration; and then there is, <hi>Cor &amp; cor, Cor duplex,</hi> a double heart, a doubtful, a diſtracted heart, which is not incogitancy, nor inconſideration, but purplexity and irreſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and laſtly <hi>Cor vagum,</hi> a wandring, a wayfaring, a weary heart, which is neither, inconſideration, nor irreſolution, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy; and this is a trinity againſt our unity, three enemies to that fixation and intireneſs of the heart, which God loves; incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration when we do not debate, irreſolution when we do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, inconſtancy when we do not perſevere; and upon each of theſe,<note place="margin">Cor nullum.</note> be pleaſed to ſtop your devotion a few minuts.</p>
            <p>This firſt is, <hi>Cor nullum,</hi> no heart at all, incogitancy, thoughtleſneſs. An idle body is a diſeaſe in a ſtate; an idle ſoul is a monſter in a man; <hi>That body that will not work muſt not eat,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 3.10.</note> but ſtarve; that ſoul that does not think nor conſider, cannot be ſaid to Actuate (which is the proper operation of the Soul) but to Evaporate; not to work in the body, but to breath and ſmoak through the body. We have ſeen eſtates of private men waſted by inconſideration, as well as by riot,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:93368:118"/>
and a ſoul may periſh by a thoughtleſneſs, as well as by ill thoughts; God takes it as ill to be ſlighted as to be injur'd; and God is as much ſlighted, in <hi>Corde nullo</hi> in our thoughtleſneſs and inconſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as he is oppoſed and provoked <hi>in Corde maligno</hi> in a rebellious heart: There is a good nullification of the heart, a good bringing of the heart to nothing, for the fire of Gods ſpirit may take hold of me, and (as the Diſciples that went with Chriſt to <hi>Emaus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 24.</note> were affected) my heart may burn within me, when the Scriptures are opened, that is, when Gods Judgments are denounced againſt my ſin; and this heat may overcome my former frigidity and coldneſs, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come my ſucceeding tepidity and lukewarmneſs, and may bring my heart to a mollification, to a tenderneſs, as <hi>Job</hi> found it, <hi>The Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath troubled me, and made my heart ſoft;</hi> for there are hearts of clay as well as hearts of wax; hearts whom theſe fires of God,<note place="margin">23.16.</note> his corrections, harden: but if theſe fires of his, theſe denuntiations of his Judgments, have overcome firſt my coldneſs, and then my lukewarmneſs, and made my heart ſoft for better impreſſions, the work is well advanced, but it is not all done; for mettle may be ſoft and yet not fuſil; iron may be red hot, and yet not apt to run into an other mold. Therefore there is a liquefaction, a melting, a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wering out of the heart, ſuch as <hi>Rahab</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Joſhuahs</hi> ſpies:<note place="margin">2.11. &amp; 5.1.</note> as ſoon as we heard how miraculouſly God had proceeded in your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, in drying up <hi>Jurdan,</hi> all our hearts melted within us, and no man had any ſpirit left in him; and when upon the conſideration of Gods miraculous Judgments or mercies, I come to ſuch a melting and pouring out of my heart, that there be no ſpirit that is, none of my one ſpirit left in me, when I have ſo exhauſted, ſo evacuated my ſelf, that is; all confidence in my ſelf, that I come into the hands of my God as pliably as ductily, as that firſt clod of earth of which he made me in <hi>Adam,</hi> was in his hands, in which clod of earth, there was a kind of reluctation againſt Gods purpoſe; this is a bleſſed nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the heart. When I ſaid to my ſelf as the Apoſtle profeſſed of himſelf, <hi>I am nothing,</hi> and then ſay to God,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.11.</note> Lord though I be nothing, yet behold I preſent thee, as much as thou hadſt to make the whole world of; O thou that madſt the whole world of nothing, make me, that am nothing in my own eyes, a new creature in Chriſt Jeſus; this is a bleſſed nullification, a glorious annihillation of the heart. So is there alſo a bleſſed nullification thereof in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition of the heart, in the ſenſe of my ſins; when as a ſharp wind may have worn out a marble Statue, or a continual ſpout worne out a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Pavement; ſo my holy tears made holy in his blood, that gives them a tincture, and my holy ſighs made holy in that ſpirit that breaths them in me, have worn out my marble heart, that is, the marbleneſs of my heart, and emptied the room of that former heart, and ſo given God a vacuity, a new place to create a new heart in: but when God hath thus created a new heart, that is, re-enabled me,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:93368:119"/>
by his ordinance to ſome holy function, then to put this heart to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, to think nothing, to conſider nothing, not to know our age, but by the Church-book, and not by any action done in the courſe of our lives, for our God, for our Prince, for our Country, for our Neighbour, for our ſelves, (our ſelves are our Souls,) not to know the ſeaſons of the year but by the fruits; which we eat, and not by obſervation of the publick and national bleſſings which he hath ſucceſſively given us; not to know religion but by the conveniency and the preferments to he had in this, or in the other ſide; to ſit here and not to know if we be ask'd upon a ſurprize, whether it were a prayer or a Sermon, or an Antheme that we heard laſt, this is ſuch a nullification of the heart, ſuch an annihillation, ſuch an exinanition thereof as reflects upon God himſelf; for <hi>Reſpuit dato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem,</hi>

               <note place="margin">Cor duplex.</note> the double, the divided, the diſtracted heart, which is not inconſideration but irreſolution. This irreſolution, this perple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xity is intended in that comination from God, <hi>The Lord ſhall give them a trembling heart;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 28.65.</note> this is not that <hi>Cor nullum,</hi> that melted heart in which there was no ſpirit left in them, as in <hi>Joſhuahs</hi> time, but <hi>Cor pavidum,</hi> a heart that ſhould not know where to ſettle, nor what to wiſh, but as it follows there, in the morning he ſhall ſay, would God it were evening, and in the evening would God it were morning; and this is that which <hi>Salomon</hi> may have intended in his prayer:<note place="margin">1 Reg. 3.9.</note> 
               <hi>Give thy ſervant an underſtanding heart; Cor docile;</hi> So St. <hi>Hierome</hi> reads it, a heart able to conceive counſel; for thats a good diſpoſition, but it is not all; for the original is, <hi>lcb. ſhemeany,</hi> that is, <hi>Cor audiens,</hi> a heart willing to hearken to counſel; but all that is, not all that is asked: <hi>Solomon</hi> askes there a heart to diſcern between good and evil; ſo that it is a prayer for the ſpirit of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of concluſion, of reſolution; that God would give him a heart willing to receive counſel, and a heart capable to conceive and digeſt counſel, and a heart able to diſcern between counſel and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and to reſolve, conclude, determine.

               <hi>&amp; ſi in ſuo genere non ſordidetur;</hi> though in the nature thereof, that with which a purer mettle is mixt be not baſe, yet it abaſes the purer mettle: he puts his example in ſilver and gold: though ſilver be a pretious mettle, yet it abaſes gold, grace and peace and faith are pretious parts of our treaſure here; yet if we mingle them, that is, compare them with the joyes and glory of heaven, if we come to think that our grace and peace and faith here, can no more be loſt, then our joy and glory there, we abaſe and we over-allay thoſe, joys and that glory. <hi>The Kingdome of heaven is like to a treaſure,</hi> ſaies our Saviour,<note place="margin">Mar. 13.44.</note> but is it all? is any treaſure like unto it? none; for (to end where we begun) treaſure is <hi>depoſitum in craſtinum,</hi> proviſion for to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: the treaſure of the worldly man is not ſo; he is not ſure of any thing to morrow. Nay the treaſure of the godly man is not ſo in this world; he is not ſure that this dayes grace and peace and faith ſhall be his to morrow; when I have joy &amp; glory in heaven, I ſhall be ſure of that to morrow. And thats a term long enough; for before to morrow there muſt be a night; and ſhall there ever be night in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, no more then day in hell, there ſhall be no Sun in heaven,<note place="margin">Apoc 21.23.</note> therefore no danger of Sun-ſet. And for the treaſure it ſelf, when the holy Ghoſt hath told us that the wals &amp; ſtreets of that City are pure gold, that the foundations thereof are all pretious ſtones, and every gate of an intire pearl, what hath the Holy Ghoſt himſelf left to denote unto us? what the treaſure it ſelf within is? the treaſure it ſelf is the Holy Ghoſt himſelf and joy in him, As the Holy Ghoſt

proceeds from the Father and the Sonne, (but I know not how) ſo there ſhall ſomething proceed from Father, Sonne and Holy Ghoſt, and fall upon me, but I know not what: nay not fall upon me nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but enwrap me, embrace me; for I ſhall be below them, ſo as that I ſhall not be upon the ſame ſeat with the Son, at the right hand of the Father, in the union of the holy Ghoſt; rectified by the power of the Father, and feel no weakneſs; enlightned by the wiſdom of the Son, and feel no ſcruple; eſtabliſhed by the joy of the holy Ghoſt, and feel no jealouſie. Where I ſhall find the Fathers of the firſt ages, dead 5000 years before me, and they ſhall not be able to ſay they were there a minute before me. Where I ſhall find the bleſſed and glorious Martyrs, who went not <hi>Per viam lacteam,</hi> but <hi>per viam ſanguineam,</hi> not by the milky way of an innocent life, but by the bloody way of a violent death, and they ſhall not contend with me for precedency in their own right, or ſay, we came in by Purchaſe, and you but by pardon. Where I ſhall find the Virgins, and not be deſpiſed by them for not being ſo; but hear that redinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration which I ſhall receive in Jeſus Chriſt, call'd Virginity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tireneſs. Where all tears ſhall be wip'd from my eyes; not only tears of compunction for my ſelf, and tears of compaſſion for others, but even tears of joy too, for there ſhall be no ſudden joy, no joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced there; there I ſhall have all joyes altogether, alwaies. There <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhall not be gladder of his own ſalvation then of mine, nor I ſurer of the everlaſtingneſs of my God, then of my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſtingneſs in him. This is that treaſure, of which the God of this treaſure gives us, thoſe ſpangles and that ſingle money which this minute can coin, this world can receive, that is, Proſperity and a good uſe thereof in worldly things, and grace and peace, and faith in ſpiritual, and then reſerve for us the exaltation of this treaſure, in the joy and glory of heaven, in the mediation of his Son Chriſt Jeſus, and by the operation of his bleſſed Spirit.</p>

            <p>THis is one of thoſe ſeaven Epiſtles, which <hi>Athanaſius</hi> and <hi>Origen</hi> called Catholique; that is, univerſall, perchance becauſe they are not directed to any one Church, as ſome others are, but to all the Chriſtian World: and Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> called them Canonical; perchance becauſe all Rules, all Canons of holy converſation are compriſed in theſe Epiſtles; and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and <hi>Oecumenius</hi> called them circular, perchance becauſe as in a circle, you cannot diſcern which was the firſt point, nor in which the compaſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the circle; ſo neither can we diſcern in theſe Epiſtles, whom the Holy Ghoſt begins withall, whom he means principally, King or Subject, Prieſt or People, ſingle or married, Husband or Wife, Fathers or Children, Maſters or Servants, but univerſally, promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, indifferently, they give all rules, for all actions, to all perſons, at all times and in all places; as in this Text in particular, which is not by any precedent or ſubſequent relation, by any connexion or coherence, directed upon any company or any degree of men; for the Apoſtle does not ſay, ye Princes, nor ye People, but ye, ye in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall to all, <hi>So ſpeak ye, and ſo doe, as they that ſhall be judged by the law of liberty:</hi> ſo theſe Epiſtles are Catholique, ſo they are cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, and they are circular too. But yet though in a circle we know not where the compaſs began, we know not which was the firſt point yet we know that the laſt point of the circle returns to the firſt and ſo becomes all one, and as much as we know the laſt, we know the firſt point. Since then the laſt point of that circle, in which God hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us to move is a Kingdome (for it is the Kingdome of Heaven) and it is a Court, (for it is that glorious Court which is the preſence of God in the Communion of his Saints) it is a fair and a pious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; for this congregation, here preſent now in this place, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the firſt point of this circle of our Apoſtle here is a Court too, and that the Holy Ghoſt in propoſing theſe duties in his general ye, does principally intend, ye that live in Court, ye whom God
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:93368:124"/>
brings ſo near to the ſight of himſelf, and of his Court in heaven, as that you have alwayes the picture of himſelf, and the portracture of his Court in your eyes; for a religious King is the Image of God, and a religious Court is a copy of the Communion of Saints: And therefore be you content to think, that to you eſpecially our Apoſtle ſaies here, ye, ye who have a neerer propinquity to God, and more aſſiduous converſation with God, by having better helps then other inferior ſtations do afford, (for though God be ſeen in a weed, in a worm, yet he is ſeen more clearly in the Sun) <hi>ſo ſpeak ye, and ſo do, as they that ſhall be Judged by the law of liberty.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Diviſio.</note>Now as the firſt Divels were in heaven, (for it was not the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which they feel in hel, but the ſin which they committed in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which made them devils) &amp; yet the falt was not in God, nor in the place; ſo if the greateſt ſins be committed in Courts, (as even in Rome, where thy will needs have an innocent Church, yet they cauſe a guilty Court,) the faults are perſonal, theirs that do them; and there is no higher Author of their ſin. The Apoſtle does not bid us ſay; that it is ſo in Courts, but leaſt it ſhould come to be ſo, he bids us give theſe rules to Courts, <hi>ſo ſpeak ye, and ſo do, as they that ſhall be Judged by the law of liberty.</hi> Firſt then, here is no expreſs precept given, no direct commandment to ſpeak; the holy Ghoſt ſaw there would be ſpeaking enough in Courts; for though there may be a great ſin in ſilence, a great prevarication in not ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in a good cauſe, or for an oppreſs'd perſon, yet the loweſt voice in a Court, wiſpering it ſelf, ſpeaks aloud, and reaches far; and therefore, hear is only a rule to regulate our ſpeach, <hi>Sic loquimini,</hi> ſo ſpeak ye. And then, as here is no expreſs precept for ſpeaking, ſo here is no expreſs precept for doing: The holy Ghoſt ſaw there would be doing enough, buſineſs enough in Court; for as ſilence, and half-ſilence; whiſpering may have a loud voice, ſo, even undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be a buſie doing, and therefore, here is only a rule, to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late our doing to, <hi>Sic facite,</hi> So do ye: And laſtly, as there is ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king enough, even in ſilence, and doing enough, even in undoing, in Court, ſo the Court is alwaies under Judgment enough. Every diſcontented perſon that hath miſs'd his preferment, though he have not merited it; every drunkard, that is over-heat, though not with his own wine; every conjecturing perſon, that is not within the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to know the ends or the waies of great actions, will Judg the higheſt counſels, and execution of thoſe counſels. The Court is under Judgment enough, and they take liberty enough; and therefore here is a rule to regulate our liberty, a law of liberty: <hi>ſo ſpeak ye,</hi> and <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But though for the more benefit of the preſent Congregation, we fix the firſt point of this Circle, that is, the principal purpoſe of the holy Ghoſt upon the Court, yet our text is an Amphitheater; an Amphitheater conſiſts of two Theaters: our text hath two parts, in which all men, all may ſit and ſee themſelves

acted firſt in the obligation that is laid upon us, upon us all, <hi>Sic loqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini, Sic facite,</hi> and then in the reaſon of this holy diligence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious cautelouſneſs, <hi>quia Judicandi;</hi> becauſe you are all to be Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which two general parts, the obligation, and the reaſon, flowing into many ſub-divided branches, I ſhall, I think, do better ſervice, both to your underſtanding and to your memory, and to your affections and conſciences, to preſent them, as they ſhall ariſe anon in their order, then to pour them out all at once now.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, in our firſt part, we look to our rule in the firſt duty,<note place="margin">Firſt part. <hi>Loquimini.</hi>
               </note> our ſpeaking, <hi>Sic loquimini,</hi> ſo ſpeak ye. The Comick Poet gives us a good caution, <hi>Si ſervus ſemper conſueſcat ſilentio, fiat nequam;</hi> that ſervant that ſaies nothing, thinks ill. As our nullifidians, men that put all upon works, and no faith, and our ſolifidians, men that put all upon, faith &amp; no works, are both in the wrong; ſo there is a danger in <hi>multiloquio,</hi> &amp; another in <hi>nulliloquio;</hi> he that ſpeaks over-freely to me, may be a man of dangerous converſation, and the ſilent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd man, that makes no play, but obſerves and ſaies nothing, may be more dangerous then he: As the Roman Emperor profeſſed to ſtand more in fear of one pale man, and lean man, then of twenty that ſtudied, and purſued their pleaſures, and lov'd there eaſe, becauſe ſuch would be glad to keep things in the ſtate they then were, but the other ſort affected changes, ſo for the moſt part, he that will ſpeak, lies as open to me as I to him; ſpeech is the balance of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. Therefore as gold is not <hi>merx,</hi> but <hi>pretium,</hi> Gold is not ware, but the price of all ware, ſo ſpeaking is not doing; but yet fair ſpeaking prepares an acceptation before, and puts a value after, upon the beſt actions. God hath made other creatutes <hi>Gregalia,</hi> ſociable, beſides man; ſheep, and deer, and pigeons will flock, and heard, and troop and meet together; but when they are met, they are not able to tell one another why they met. Man only can ſpeak; ſilence makes it but a hearding; that that makes converſation, is ſpeech. <hi>Qui datum deſerit, reſpuit datorem,</hi> ſaies <hi>Tertullian;</hi> He that uſes not a benefit, reproaches his benefactor. To declare Gods goodneſs that hath enabled us to ſpeak, we are bound to ſpeak: ſpeech is the glue, the ciment, the ſoul of converſation, and of religion too.</p>
            <p>Now, your converſation is in heaven; and therefore <hi>loquimini Deo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deo.</note> firſt ſpeak to him that is in heaven, ſpeak to God. Some of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick Philoſophers thought it a prophanation of God, to ſpeak to God; they thought that when our thoughts were made prayers, and that the heart ſlow'd into the tongue, and that we had inveſted, and apparall'd our meditations with words, this was a kind of painting and dreſſing, and a ſuperfluous diligence, that rather taſted of humane affections, then ſuch a ſincere ſervice, as was fit for the preſence of God; only the firſt conception, the firſt ebullitions and emanations of the Soul, in the heart, they thought to be a fit ſacrifice to God, and all verball prayer to be too homely for him. But God himſelf
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:93368:125"/>
who is all ſpirit, hath yet put on bodily lineaments, head, and hands, and feet, yea, and garments too, in many places of ſcripture to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that is, to manifeſt himſelf to us; and when we appear to God, though our devotion be all ſpiritual, as he is all ſpirit, yet let us put on lineaments and apparrel upon our devotions, and digeſt the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the heart into words of the mouth. God came to us, <hi>in verbo,</hi> in the word, for Chriſt is the word that was make fleſh: let us that are Chriſtians goe to God ſo too, that the words of our mouth as well as the meditations of our heart, may be acceptable to him. Surely, God loves the ſervice of prayer, or he would never have built a houſe for prayer; and therefore we juſtly call publique prayer, the liturgy, ſervice: love that place, and love that ſervice in that place: prayer, They will needs make us believe that St. <hi>Francis</hi> preached to birds, and beaſts, and ſtones; but they will not go about to make us believe that thoſe birds, and beaſts, and ſtones joyn'd with St. <hi>Francis</hi> in prayer. God can ſpeak to all things; thats the office of preaching to ſpeak to others; but of all, only man can ſpeak to God, and thats the office of prayer. It is a bleſſed converſation to ſpend time in diſcourſe in communication with God.<note place="margin">Gen. 18. ult.</note> 
               <hi>God went his way aſſoon as he had left communing with</hi> Abraham: When we leave praying, God leaves us; but God left not <hi>Abraham,</hi> as long as he had any thing to ſay to God; and we have alwayes ſomething to ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; he loves to hear us tel him even thoſe things which he knew before; His benefits in our thankfulneſs, and our ſins in our confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and our neceſſities in our petitions: And therefore having ſo many occaſions to ſpeak to God, and to ſpeak of God, <hi>David</hi> inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates that (and his ingemination implies a wonder) <hi>O that men would</hi> (and it is ſtrange if men will not) <hi>O that men would,</hi> ſayes he, more than once or twice, <hi>O that men would praiſe the Lord, and tell the wondrous works that he hath done for the ſons of men;</hi> for <hi>David</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines not his precept in that,<note place="margin">Pſ. 100 4.</note> 
               <hi>Be thankfull unto him;</hi> for a thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may paſſe in private, but, <hi>Be thankful unto him and ſpeak good of his name:</hi> Glorifie him in ſpeaking to him, in ſpeaking of him, in ſpeaking for him.</p>

               <hi>Loquimini Deo,</hi> ſpeak to God and <hi>loquimini Diis,</hi> ſpeak to them, whom God hath called Gods. As religious Kings are bound to ſpeak to God by way of prayer; ſo thoſe who have that ſacred of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and thoſe that have that honourable office to do ſo, are bound to ſpeak to Kings by way of Counſil. God hath made all good men partakers of the divine nature; they are the ſons of God, the ſeed of God; but God hath made kings partakers of his office and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration. And as between man and himſelf God hath put a Mediator, that conſiſts of God and Man; ſo between Princes and People, God hath put Mediators too, who conſidered in themſelves retain the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the people, (ſo Chriſt did of man) but conſidered in their places, have fair and venerable beames of his power and influences of
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:93368:125"/>
him upon them. And as our Mediator, Chriſt Jeſus, found alwaies his Fathers ears open to him; ſo do the Church and State enter bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly and ſucceſfully by theſe Mediators into the ears of the King. Of our Mediator Chriſt himſelf it is ſaid, that he offered up prayers,<note place="margin">Heb. 5.7.</note> and ſtrong cryes, and tears; even Chriſt was put to ſome difficulties in his mediation for thoſe that were his: but he was heard, ſayes that Text, in that he feared: Even in thoſe things wherein, in ſome emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent difficulties, they may be afraid they ſhall not, theſe mediators are graciouſly and opportunely heard too in their due diſcharge of their offices. That which was <hi>Davids</hi> prayer, is our poſſeſſion, our happineſs; <hi>Let not the foot of pride come againſt us;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſ. 36.11.</note> we know there is no pride in the head; and becauſe there is no fault in the hands nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that is, in them into whoſe hands this bleſſed Mediatorſhip is committed, by the great places of power and counſail which they worthilie hold, the foot of pride, forein or home oppreſſion does not, ſhall not tread us down. And for the continuation of this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, let me have leave to ſay with <hi>Mordechais</hi> humilitie and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs too, to all ſuch mediators, that which he ſaid to <hi>Eſther,</hi>

            <p>And this is truly, moſt literally the purpoſe of the Apoſtle here,<note place="margin">Imaginibus Dei</note> that you undervalue no man for his outward appearance;<note place="margin">v. 2.</note> that you over-value no man for his goodly apparrell or gold rings; that you ſay not to a poor man ſtand thou here, or if you admit him to ſit, ſit here under my footſtool:<note place="margin">v. 3.</note> but it is a precept of acceſſibleneſs and of affability; affability, that is, a civility of the City of God and a court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Court of Heaven to receive other men, the images of God, with the ſame eaſineſs that God received you. God ſtands at the dore and knocks, and ſtaies our leiſure to ſee if we will open and let him in: even at the dore of his beloved he ſtood and knock'd, <hi>till his head was fil'd mith dew, and his locks with the drops of the night:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Apoc. 3.20. Cant. 5.2.</note> But God puts none of us to that which he puts himſelf and his Chriſt; but, <hi>knock,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>and it ſhall be opened unto you;</hi>

not believe that God would anſwer his expectation at one ſtriking; God is no inacceſſible God, that he may not be come to, nor inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable, that he will not be mov'd if he be ſpoken to, nor dilatory, that he does not that he does ſeaſonably. <hi>Daniel</hi> preſents God <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quum Dierum,</hi> as an old man; but that is as a reverend not as a froward perſon,<note place="margin">Ambro.</note>

This, this godlineſs, (that is, knowledg and obedience to the law) hath the promiſes of this life, and the next too, all referr'd to his law: for without this, this godlineſs, (which is holineſs) no man ſhall ſee God: all referr'd to a law. This is Chriſts Catechiſm in St. <hi>John,</hi> that we might know the only true God,<note place="margin">17.3.</note> and Jeſus Chriſt whom he ſent, a God commanding, and a Chriſt reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us, if we have tranſgreſs'd that commandment; and this is the holy Ghoſt's Catechiſm in St. <hi>Paul, Deus remunerator,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11.6.</note> that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve God to be, and to be a juſt rewarder of mans actions; ſtill all referr'd to an obedience, or diſobedience of a law. The myſtery of godlineſs is great, that is, great enough for our ſalvation, and yet without controverſie. For though controverſies have been mov'd about Gods firſt act, there can be none of his laſt act; though men have diſputed of the object of election, yet of the ſubject of executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there is no controverſie: no man can doubt, but that when God delivers over any ſoul actually, and by way of execution to eternal condemnation, that he delivers over that ſoul to that eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, for breaking this law. In this we have no other adverſary but the over-ſad, the deſpairing ſoul; and it becomes us all, to lend our hand to his ſuccor, and ſo pour in our wine and our oyl, into his wounds, that lies weltring and ſurrounded in the blood of his own pale and exhauſted ſoul; that ſoul, who though it can teſtifie to it ſelf, ſome endeavour to the waies of holineſs; yet upon ſome collatteral doubts, is ſtill ſuſpicious and jealous of God. How often have we ſeen, that a needleſs jealouſie and ſuſpicion conceiv'd without cauſe, hath made a good body bad? a needleſs jealouſie and ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of his purpoſes, and intentions upon thee, may make thy merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God angry too. Nothing can alienate God more from thee, then to think that any thing but ſin can alienate him. How wouldſt thou have God merciful to thee, if thou wilt be unmerciful to God himſelf? And <hi>qui quid tyrannicum in Deo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Baſil.</note> He that conceives any ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:93368:128"/>
act in God is unjuſt to the God of Juſtice, and unmerciful to the God of mercy. Therefore in the 17th. of our injunctions we are commanded to arm ſad ſouls againſt deſpair, by ſetting forth the mercy and the benefits, and the godlineſs of Almighty God: (as the word of the injunction is, the godlineſs of God;) for to leave God under a ſuſpicion of dealing ill with any penitent ſoul, were to impute ungodlineſs to God. Therefore to that miſtaking ſoul, that diſcompos'd, that ſhiver'd, and ſhriveled, and ravell'd and ruin'd ſoul, to that jealous and ſuſpicious ſoul only, I ſay with the Apoſtle, let no man Judg you, intruding into thoſe things which he hath not ſeen.<note place="margin">Coloſ. 2.18.</note> Let no man make you afraid of ſecret purpoſes in God, which they have not, nor you have not ſeen; for that by which you ſhall be Judged, is the law, that law which was notified and publiſhed to you. The law alone were much too heavy, if there were not a ſupra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant eaſe and alleviation in that hand, that Chriſt Jeſus reaches out to us. O conſider the weight and the eaſe; and for pitty to ſuch diſtruſtful ſouls, and for eſtabliſhing of your own, ſtop your devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons a little, upon this conſideration: firſt, there is <hi>Chirograpbum,</hi> A hand writing of Ordinances againſt me;<note place="margin">v. 14.</note> a debt, an obligation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by our firſt Parents in their diſobedience; and faln upon me. And even that, (be it but original ſin) is ſhrewd evidence; ther's my firſt charge. But <hi>deletum eſt,</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle there, that's blotted, thats defac'd, that cannot be ſued againſt me after baptiſm: nay <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latum cruci affixum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">28.15.</note> It is cancell'd, it is naild to the Croſs of Chriſt Jeſus, it is no more ſin, in it ſelf it is; but to me to condemnation it is not; ther's my charge, and my diſcharge for that. But yet there is a heavier evidence; <hi>Pactum cum inferno,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Iſai</hi> ſpeaks; <hi>I have made a Covenant with death, &amp; with hell I am at an agreement;</hi> that is, ſaies St. <hi>Gregory, Audacter, indeſinentur peccamus, et diligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, amicitiam profitemur:</hi> We ſin conſtantly, and we ſin continually, and we ſin confidently, and we find ſo much pleaſure and profit in ſin, as that we have made a league, and ſworn a friendſhip with ſin; &amp; we keep that perverſe, &amp; irreligious promiſe, over-religiouſly; &amp; the ſins of our youth flow into other ſins, when age diſables us for them. But yet there is a <hi>delectum eſt,</hi> in this caſe too, our Covenant with death is diſannull'd, (ſaies that Prophet) when we are made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the death of Chriſt, in the bleſſed Sacrament; mine actual ſins loſe their act, and mine habitual ſins fall from me, as a habit as a garment put of, when I come to that; ther's my charge, and my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge for that. But yet there is worſe evidence againſt me, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this <hi>Chirographum,</hi> the firſt hand writing of <hi>Adams</hi> hand, or then this <hi>pactum,</hi> this contract of mine own hand, actual and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſin, (for of theſe, one is waſh'd out in water, and the other in blood,<note place="margin">Ro. 7.20.</note> in the two Sacraments.) But then there is <hi>Lex in membris,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, I find a law, <hi>that when I would do good, evil is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with me;</hi> Sin aſſiſted by me, is now become a Tyrant over me;
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:93368:128"/>
and hath eſtabliſh'd a government upon me, and therefore is a law of ſin, and a law in my fleſh, which after the water of baptiſm taken, and the water of penitent tears given; after the blood of Chriſt Jeſus ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and mine one blood given, (that is, a holy readineſs at that time, when I am made partaker of Chriſts death, to die for Chriſt,) throws me back by relapſes, into thoſe repented ſins. This put the Apoſtle to that paſſionate exclamation, <hi>O wretched man that I am;</hi> and yet he found a deliverance, even from the body of his death through Jeſus Chriſt his Lord, that is, a free and open recourſe, and acceſs to him in all oppreſſions of heart, in all dejections of ſpirit. Now, when this <hi>Chirographum,</hi> this band of <hi>Adams</hi> hand, Original ſin, is cancell'd upon the Croſs of Chriſt, and this <hi>pactum,</hi> this band of mine own hand, actual ſins, waſh'd away in the blood of Chriſt, and this <hi>Lex in membris,</hi> this diſpoſition to relapſe into repented ſins, (which as a tide that does certainly come every day, does come eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, in one form or other) is beaten back (as a tide by a bank) by a continual oppoſing the merits, and the example of Chriſt Jeſus, and the practice of his faſting, &amp; ſuch other medicinal diſciplines, as I find to prevail againſt ſuch relapſes, when by this bleſſed means the whole law, againſt which I am a treſpaſſer, is evacuated, will God condemn me for all this, and not by a law? when I have pleaded Chriſt, &amp; Chriſt, and Chriſt baptiſm, and blood and tears, will God condemn mean oblique way, when he cannot by a direct way? by a ſecret pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, when he hath no law to condemn me by? Sad and diſcompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, diſtorted and diſtracted ſoul; if it be well ſaid in the School, <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdum eſt diſputare ex manuſcriptis,</hi> it is an unjuſt thing, in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies and diſputations, to preſs arguments out of manuſcripts, that cannot be ſeen by every man; it were ill ſaid in thy conſcience, that God will proceed againſt thee, <hi>ex manuſcriptis,</hi> or condemn thee upon any thing, which thou never ſawſt, any unreveal'd purpoſe of his. Suſpicious ſoul, ill-preſaging ſoul, is there ſomething elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the day of Judgment, that the Son of man does not know? diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet ſoul, does he not know the proceeding of that Judgment, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf is to be Judg? but that when he hath died for thy ſins, and ſo fulfill'd the law in thy behalf, thou maiſt be condemn'd without reſpect of that law, and upon ſomething, that ſhall have had no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, no relation to any ſuch breach, of any ſuch law in thee? Intricated entangled conſcience, Chriſt tels thee of a Judgment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou didſt not do the works of mercy, not feed, not cloth the poor: for theſe were enjoyn'd thee by a law; but he never tels thee of any Judgment therefore, becauſe thy name was written in a dark book of death, never unclaps'd, never opened unto thee in thy life. He ſaies to the lovingly &amp; indulgently, fear not, for it is Gods good pleaſure to give you the Kingdom; but he never ſaies to the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the world, live in fear, dy in anxiety, in ſuſpition and ſuſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for his diſpleaſure; a diſpleaſure conceiv'd againſt you before you
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:93368:129"/>
were ſinners, before you were men, hath thrown you out of that kingdom into utter darkneſs. <hi>There is no condemnation to them, that are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> The reaſon is added, becauſe the law of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of life hath made them free from the law of ſin and of death: All, upon all ſides, is ſtill refer'd to a law. And where there is no law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, (as there is not to him that is in Chriſt; and he is in Chriſt, who hath endeavoured the keeping or repented the breaking of the law) God wil never proceed to execution by any ſecret purpoſe ever notified, never manifeſted. Suſpicious, jealous, ſcattered ſoul recollect thy ſelf, and give thy ſelf that redintegration, that acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence which the ſpirit of God, in the means of the Church offers thee, ſtudy the myſterie of godlineſs which is without all controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, that is, endeavour to keep, repent the not keeping of the law and thou art ſafe, for that you ſhall be judged by, is a law. But then this law, is called here a law of liberty; and whether that denotation, that it is called a law of liberty, import an eaſe to us or heavier weight up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, is our laſt diſquiſition and concluſion of all; <hi>So ſpeak ye, and ſo do, as they that ſhall be judged by the law of liberty.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Lex libertatis.</note>That the Apoſtle here by the law of liberty means the Goſpel was never doubted; he had call'd the Goſpel ſo before this place; <hi>whoſo looketh into the perfect law of liberty,</hi>

The holy Ghoſt calls the Goſpel a pearl, and a treaſure, and a kingdome, and joy, and glory; Not to allure men with falſe names, but becauſe men love theſe; and the Goſpel is truly all theſe, a pearl, and a treaſure, and a kingdome, and joy, and glory; And it is truly a law of liberty; but of what kind, and in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect? not ſuch a liberty as they have eſtabliſhed in the Roman Church, where Eccleſiaſtical liberty muſt exempt Eccleſiaſtical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from participating all burdens of the State, and from being trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, though they commit treaſon, becauſe they are Subjects to no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Prince; nor the liberty of the Anabaptiſt that overthrows Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, and conſequently all ſubjection both Eccleſiaſtical &amp; Laick for when upon thoſe words,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.23.</note> 
               <hi>Be ye not ſervants of men,</hi> St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſayes, This is Chriſtian liberty, <hi>Nec aliis, nec ſibi ſervire,</hi> neither to be ſubjects to others nor to our ſelves, that's ſpoken with modification an allegiance with relation to our firſt allegiance, to God; not to be ſo ſubject to others, or to our ſelves, as that either for their ſakes or our own, we depart from any neceſſary declaration of our ſervice to God.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Deo.</note>Firſt then, the Goſpel is a Law of Liberty, in reſpect of the author of the Goſpel of God himſelf, becauſe it leaves God at his liberty: Not at liberty to judg againſt his Goſpel, where he hath manifeſted it for a law; for he hath laid a holy neceſſity upon himſelf to judg ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:93368:129"/>
to that law, where he hath publiſhed that law: But at liberty ſo, as that it conſiſts only in his good pleaſure, to what nation he will publiſh the goſpel, or in what nation he will continue the goſpel, or upon what perſons he wil make this goſpel effectual. So <hi>Oecumenius,</hi> (who is no ſingle witneſs, nor ſpeaks not alone, but compiles the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Fathers) places this liberty in God, That God is at liberty to give this goſpel where he will, and at liberty ſo, as that he hath exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no man, how well ſoever he love him, nor put any ſuch fetters or manicles upon himſelf, but that he can and will puniſh thoſe that tranſgreſſe this law. So it is a law of liberty to God; nothing determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon any man, nothing concluded in himſelf, lies ſo in Gods way, as to hinder him from proceeding in his laſt judgment, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the keeping or breaking of this law; ſtill God is at liberty.</p>
            <p>And it is a law of liberty in reſpect of us: Of us,<note place="margin">Nobis.</note> who are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; and conſidered ſo, either with a reſpect to the natural man, or with a reſpect to the Jew; for, if we compare the Chriſtian with the natural man, the law of nature layes the ſame obligation upon the natural man, as the goſpel does upon the Chriſtian, for the moral part thereof. The chriſtian is no more bound to love God, nor his neighbor, than the natural man is; therein the natural man hath no more liberty, than the chriſtian; So far their law is equal: And then, all the law, which the chriſtian hath and the natural man hath not, is a law of liberty to the chriſtian, that is, a law that gives him an eaſe and a readier way to perform thoſe duties; which way the naturall man hath not, and yet is bound to the ſame duties. The natural man, if he trangreſs that law which he finds in his own heart, finds a condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in himſelf, as well as the chriſtian; therein he is no freer than the chriſtian: But he finds no Sanctuary, no Altar, no Sacrifice, no Church, no ſuch liberty as the Chriſtian does in the Goſpel. So the Goſpel is a law of liberty to us, in reſpect of the natural man, that it ſets us at liberty, reſtores us to liberty after we are fallen into priſon for debt, into Gods diſpleaſure for ſin, by affording us means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation to God again.</p>
            <p>It is ſo alſo in reſpect of the law given by God to the Jews:<note place="margin">Judaei.</note> The Jews had liberties; that is, refuge and help of ſacrifices for ſin, which the natural man had not: For, if the natural man were driven and followed from his own heart, that he ſaw no comfort of an innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy there, he had no other liberties to fly to, no comfort in any other thing, no law, no promiſe annexed to any other action; not to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice as the Jew, or to Sacrament as the Chriſtian, but muſt irreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diably ſink under the condemnation of his own heart. The Jew had this liberty, a law; and a law, that involv'd the Goſpel; But then the goſpel was to the Jew but as a letter ſeal'd, and the Jew was but as a ſervant who was truſted to carry the letter as it was ſeal'd to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to carry it to the Chriſtian. Now the Chriſtian hath receiv'd this letter at the Jews hand, and he opens it; he ſees the Jews pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy

The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is come from ſchool to the Univerſity; from grammer to lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick; to him that is <hi>Logos,</hi> it ſelf, the word; to apprehend and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Chriſt himſelf; and ſo is at more liberty, than when he had only a dark law, without any comment with the natural man, or only a dark comment, that is, the law with a dim light, and ill eys, as the Jews had; for though the Jew had the liberty of alaw, yet they had not <hi>the law of liberty.</hi> So the goſpel is a law of liberty to God, who is ſtill at his liberty, to give and take, and to condemn according to that law; and a law of liberty to us, as we are compared to the natural man, or to the Jew. But when we confine our ſelves in our ſelves, poſitively without compariſon, it is not ſuch a law of liberty to us, as ſome men have come to a neer, ſaying, That the ſins of Gods children do them no harm; That God ſees not the ſins of his children; that God was no farther out with <hi>David</hi> in his adultery, than in his repentance; but as to be born within the covenant, that is, of chriſtian parents, does not make us chriſtians,<note place="margin">Aug.</note> (for, <hi>Non naſcitur, ſed renaſcitur, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianus,</hi>) The covenant gives us a title to the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and that ſacrament makes us chriſtians; ſo this <hi>law of liberty</hi> gives us not a liberty to ſin, but a liberty from ſin, <hi>Noli libertate abuti, ad libere peccandum,</hi> ſayes the ſame Father, It is not a liberty, but an impotency, a ſlavery to ſin: <hi>Voluntas libera, quae pia,</hi> ſayes, he, only a holy ſoul,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.17.</note> is a free ſoul, <hi>Where the ſpirit of the Lord is, there is liberty,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle:<note place="margin">Leo.</note> And, <hi>Splendidiſsimum in ſe quiſque habet ſpeculum,</hi> Every man hath, a glaſs, a cryſtal, into which, though he cannot cal up this ſpirit, (for the ſpirit of God breaths where it pleaſes him) yet he can ſee this ſpirit if he be there in that glaſs: Every man hath a glaſs in himſelf, where he may ſee himſelf, and the Image of God, ſayes that Father, and ſee how like he is to that: To dare to reflect upon my ſelf, and to ſearch all the corners of mine own conſcience, whether I have rightly uſed this <hi>law of liberty,</hi> and neither been bold before a ſin, upon preſumption of an eaſie, nor diffident after, upon

ſuſpicion of an impoſſible reconciliation to my God, this is Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical liberty.</p>
            <p>So then, (to end all) Though it be a law of liberty, becauſe it gives me better means of prevention before, and of reſtitution after, than the natural man or Jew had, yet we conſider, that it is <hi>the law of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi> this law, that hath afforded us theſe good helps, by which we ſhall be judged; And ſo though our caſe be better than theirs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have this <hi>law of liberty</hi> which they wanted, yet our caſe grows heavier than theirs if we uſe it not aright. The Jews ſhall be under a heavier condemnation than the natural man, becauſe they had more liberty, that is, more means of avoyding ſin than the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man had, and upon the ſame reaſon, the chriſtian under a heavier condemnation than either, becauſe he <hi>ſhall be judged by the law of liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What Judgement then gives this law? This;<note place="margin">Mar. 16.16.</note> 
               <hi>Qui non credide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, damnabitur;</hi> So ſayes this law, in the law-makers mouth, <hi>He that believes not ſhall be damned.</hi> And as no leſſe light than faith it ſelf, can ſhew you what faith is, what it is to believe; ſo no leſſe time than damnation ſhall laſt, can ſhew you what damnation is: For the very form of damnation is the everlaſtingneſs of it: And, <hi>qui non credide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> he that believeth not ſhall be damned; there is no commutation of penance, nor beheading after a ſentence of a more ignominious death in that Court. Doeſt thou believe that thou doeſt believe? yet this law takes not that anſwer; This <hi>law of liberty</hi> takes the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to look farther; through faith into works; for ſo ſayes the law, in the mouth of the law-maker, <hi>To whom much is given,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luc. 12.48.</note> 
               <hi>of him much ſhall be required.</hi> Haſt thou conſidered every new title of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and every new addition of office, every new ſtep into higher places, to have laid new duties, and new obligations upon thee? haſt thou doubled the hours of thy prayers when thy preferments are doubled, and encreaſed thine alms according as thy revenues are encreaſed? haſt thou done ſomething, done much in this kind? this law will not be anſwered ſo; this <hi>law of liberty</hi> takes the liberty to call upon thee for all. Here alſo the law ſaies, in the mouth of the law-maker, <hi>If thou have agreed with many adverſaries,</hi> ſayes Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.25.</note> (let that be if thou have ſatisfied many duties; (for duties are adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, that is, tentations upon us) yet as long as thou haſt one adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, agree with that adverſary quickly in the way; leave no duty undiſcharged nor unrepented in this life. Beloved, we have well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered our ſelves of the fear of Purgatory; None of us fear that; but another miſtaking hath overtaken us, and we flatter our ſelves with another danger, that is, compenſation; That by doing well in one place, our ill doing in another is recompenſed. An ill officer looks to be ſaved becauſe he is a good husband to his wife; a good father to his children; a good maſter to his ſervants; and he thinks he hath three to one for his ſalvatien. But as nature requires the qualities of
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:93368:131"/>
every element, which thou art compoſed of; ſo this <hi>law of liberty</hi> calls upon thee, for the exerciſes of all thoſe vertues, that appertain to every particular place thou holdſt. This liberty, this law of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty takes, It binds thee to believe Chriſt, all Chriſt, Gods Chriſt, as he was the eternal Son of the Father, God of God; our Chriſt, as <hi>he was made man for our ſalvation;</hi> and thy Chriſt, as his bleſſed ſpirit, in this his ordinance applies him to thee, and offers him into thine armes this minute. And then to know that he looks for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution from thee, in that meaſure in which he dealt with thee, much for much; and for ſeveral kinds of good, according to thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral good things which he hath done for thee: And if thou be firſt defective in theſe, and then defective in laying hold upon him, who is the propitiation and ſatisfaction for thy defects in theſe: This law of liberty returns to her liberty, to pronounce, and the Judg to his liberty to execute that ſentence, <hi>Damnaberis,</hi> thou wilt be caſt into priſon, where thou muſt pay the laſt farthing; thou muſt; for Chriſt dyes not there; and therefore there thou muſt lie till there come ſuch another ranſome as Chriſt; nay a greater ranſome than Chriſt was, for Chriſt paid no debts in that priſon: This then is the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans caſe, and this is the abridgment of his Religion, <hi>Sic loquimini, Sic facite;</hi> To ſpeak aright, and to do aright; to profeſſe the truth and not be afraid nor aſhamed of that, and to live according to that profeſſion: For no man can make God the author of ſin; but that man comes as neer it as he can, that makes Gods religion a cloak for his ſin. To this God proceeds not meerly, and onely by command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but by perſwaſion too; and though he be not bound to do ſo, yethe does give a reaſon: The reaſon is, becauſe we muſt give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of both; both of actions and of words; of both we ſhall be judged; But judged by a law, a law which excludes on Gods part, any ſecret ill purpoſe upon us, if we keep his law; A law which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes on our part, all pretence of ignorance; for no man can plead ignorance of a law. And then, a <hi>law of liberty;</hi> of liberty to God; for God was not bound to ſave a man becauſe he made him, but of his own goodneſs, he vouchſafed him a law, by which he may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: A <hi>law of liberty</hi> to us; ſo that there is no Epicuriſm, to do what we liſt; no ſuch liberty as makes us libertins; for then there were no law, nor Stoiciſm, nor fatality, that conſtrains us to do that we would not do, for then there were no liberty. But the Goſpel is ſuch a law of liberty as delivers us, upon whom it works, from the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of falling into the bondage of ſin, before, and from the impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of recovering after, if we be fallen into that bondage. And this is liberty enough: And of this liberty our bleſſed God give us the right uſe, for his ſon Chriſt Jeſus ſake by the operation of that holy Ghoſt that proceeds from both.</p>

            <p>AS the Prophets, and the other Secretaries of the holy Ghoſt in penning the books of Scriptures, do for the moſt part retain, and expreſs in their writings ſome impreſſions, and ſome air of their former profeſſions; thoſe that had been bred in Courts and Cities, thoſe that had been Shepheards and Heardſmen, thoſe that had been Fiſhers, and ſo of the reſt; ever inſerting into their writings ſome phraſes, ſome metaphors, ſome alluſions, taken from that profeſſion which they had exerciſed before; ſo that ſoul, that hath been tranſported upon any particular worldly pleaſure, when it is intirely turn'd upon God, and the contemplation of his all-ſufficiency and abundance, doth find in God fit ſubject, and juſt occaſion to exerciſe the ſame affection piouſly, and religiouſly, which had before ſo ſinfully tranſported, and poſſeſt it.</p>
            <p>A covetous perſon, who is now truly converted to God, he will exerciſe a ſpiritual covetouſneſs ſtill, he will deſire to have him all, he will have good ſecurity, the ſeal and aſſurance of the holy Ghoſt; and he will have his ſecurity often renewed by new teſtimonies, and increaſes of thoſe graces in him; he will have witneſſes enough; he will have the teſtimonie of all the world, by his good life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; he will gain every way at Gods hand, he will have wages of God, for he will be his ſervant; he will have a portion from God, for he will be his Son; he will have a reverſion, he will be ſure that his name is in the book of life; he will have pawns, the ſeals of the Sacraments, nay, he will have a preſent poſſeſſion; all that God hath promiſed, all that Chriſt hath purchaſed, all that the holy Ghoſt hath the ſtewardſhip and diſpenſation of, he will have all in preſent, by the appropriation and inveſtiture of an actual and applying faith; a covetous perſon converted will be ſpiritually covetous ſtill.</p>
            <p>So will a voluptuous man, who is turned to God, find plenty and

deliciouſnes enough in him, to feed his ſoul, as with marrow, and with fatneſs, as <hi>David</hi> expreſſes it; and ſo an angry and paſſionate man, will find zeal enough in the houſe of God to eat him up.</p>
            <p>All affections which are common to all men, and thoſe to which in particular, particular men have been adicted to, ſhall not only be juſtly employed upon God, but alſo ſecurely employed, becauſe we cannot exceed, nor go too far in imploying them upon him.

            <p>And according to this Rule too, <hi>Salomon,</hi> whoſe diſpoſition was amorous, and exceſſive in the love of women, when he turn'd to God, he departed not utterly from his old phraſe and language, but having put a new, and a ſpiritual tincture, and form and habit in all his thoughts, and words, he conveyes all his loving approaches and applications to God, and all Gods gracious anſwers to his amorous ſoul, into ſongs, and Epithalamians, and meditations upon contracts, and marriages between God and his Church, and between God and his ſoul; as we ſee ſo evidently in all his other writings, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in this text, <hi>I love them, &amp;c.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Auguſt.</note>In which words is expreſſed all that belongs to love, all which, is to deſire, and to enjoy; for to deſire without fruition, is a rage, and to enjoy without deſire is a ſtupidity: In the firſt alone we think of nothing, but that which we then would have; and in the ſecond a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, we are not for that, when we have it; in the firſt, we are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; in the ſecond, we were as good we were, for we have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in it; nothing then can give us ſatisfaction, but where thoſe two concurr, <hi>amare</hi> and <hi>frui,</hi> to love and to enjoy.</p>
            <p>In ſenſual love it is ſo; <hi>Quid erat quod me delectabat niſi amare et amari?</hi> I take no joy in this world, but in loving, and in being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved; in ſenſual love it is ſo, but in ſenſual love, when we are come ſo far; there is no ſatisfaction in that; the ſame Father confeſſeth more of himſelf, then any Commiſſion, any oath would have put him to, <hi>Amatus ſum, et perveni occulte ad fruendum, I had all I deſir'd,</hi> and I had it with that advantage of having it ſecretly; but what got I by all that, <hi>Ut caederer virgis ardentibus ferreis, zeli ſuſpicionis et rix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arum;</hi> nothing but to be ſcourg'd with burning iron rods, rods of jealouſie, of ſuſpition, and of quarrels; but in the love and enjoying of this text, there is no room for Jealouſie, nor ſuſpition, nor quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome complaining.</p>

               <note place="margin">Deviſio.</note>In this text then you may be pleaſed to conſider theſe two things, <hi>Quid amare, quid frui,</hi> what the affection of this love is, what is the bleſſedneſs of this enjoying; but in the firſt of theſe, we muſt firſt conſider the perſons, who are the lovers in this text; for there are
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:93368:132"/>
perſons that are incredible, though they ſay they love, becauſe they are accuſtomed to falſhood; and there are perſons which are unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable, though they be believed to love, becauſe they love not where, &amp; as they ſhould. When we have found the perſons, in a ſecond conſideration we ſhall look upon the affection it ſelf, what is the love in this text; and then after that, upon the bond, and union and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of this love, that it is mutual, I love them that love me; and having paſſed thoſe three branches of the firſt part, we ſhall in the ſecond, which is enjoying, conſider firſt, that this enjoying, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the word finding; and then that this finding requires two conditions, a ſeeking, and an early ſeeking, <hi>And they that ſeek me ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhall find me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Perſon that profeſſes love in this place is wiſdom her ſelf,<note place="margin">Firſt part. The Perſon.</note> as appears at the beginning of the Chapter; ſo that <hi>ſapere et amare,</hi> to be wiſe &amp; to love, which perchance never met before nor ſince, are met in this text: but whether this wiſdom, ſo frequently mentioned in this book of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> be <hi>ſapientia creata</hi> or <hi>increat,</hi> whether it be the wiſdom, or the root of wiſdom, Chriſt Jeſus, hath been diverſly debated: the occaſion grew in that great Councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> where the Catholick Fathers underſtood this wiſdom, to be intended of Chriſt himſelf, and then the Arrian hereticks preſſed ſome places of this book, where ſuch things ſeemed to them to be ſpoken of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as could not be applyable to any but to a Creature; and that therefore if Chriſt were this wiſdom, Chriſt muſt neceſſarily be a Creature, and not God.</p>
            <p>We will not diſpute thoſe things over again now, they are clearly enough, &amp; largely enough ſet down in that Councel; but ſince there is nothing ſaid of wiſdom in all this book, which hath not been by good expoſitors applied to Chriſt, much more may we preſume the lover in this text, (though preſented in the name of wiſdom) to be Chriſt himſelf, and ſo we do.</p>
            <p>To ſhew the conſtancy and durableneſs of this love, the lover is a he, that is Chriſt; to ſhew the vehemency and earneſtneſs of it, the lover is a ſhee, that is wiſdom, as it is often expreſſed in this Chapter, ſhe crieth, ſhe uttereth her voice; yea in one place of the Bible (and only in that one place I think) where <hi>Moſes</hi> would expreſs an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, and vehement and paſſionate indignation in God againſt his people, when as it is in that text, his wrath was kindled, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly kindled,<note place="margin">Num. 11.15.</note> there and only their doth <hi>Moſes</hi> attribute even to God himſelf the feminine ſex, and ſpeaks to God in the original lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, as if he ſhould have call'd him <hi>Deam Iratam,</hi> an angry ſhe God; all that is good then, either in the love of man or woman is in this love; for he is expreſſed in both ſexes, man and woman; and all that can be ill in the love of either ſex, is purged away, for the man is no other man then Chriſt Jeſus, and the woman no other woman, then wiſdom her ſelf, even the uncreated wiſdom of God himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:93368:133"/>Now all this is but one perſon, the perſon that profeſſes love; who is the other, who is the beloved of Chriſt, is not ſo eaſily diſcern'd: in the love between perſons in this world, and of this world, we are often deceived with outward ſigns; we often miſ-call and miſ-judg civil reſpects, and mutual courteſies; and a delight in one anothers converſation, and ſuch other indifferent things, as only malignity, and curioſity, and ſelf-guiltineſs, makes to be miſinterpretable, we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten call theſe love; but neither amongſt our ſelves, much leſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and our ſelves, are theſe outward appearances alwaies ſigns of love.</p>
            <p>This perſon then, this beloved ſoul, is not every one, to whom Chriſt ſends a loving meſſage, or writs too; for his letters his Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are directed to all; not every one he wiſhes well to and ſwears that he does ſo, for ſo he doth to all; <hi>As I live (ſaith the Lord) I would not the death of a Sinner;</hi> not every one that he ſends jewels, and preſents to; for they are often ſnares to corrupt, as well as arguments of love; not though he admit them to his table and ſupper, for even there the Devil entred into <hi>Judas</hi> with a ſop; not though he receive them to a kiſs, for even with that familarity <hi>Judas</hi> betrayed him; not though he betroth himſelf as he did to the Jews,<note place="margin">Oſc. 2.14.</note> 
               <hi>ſponſabo te mihi in aeternum;</hi> not though he make jointures, <hi>in pacto ſalis,</hi> in a covenant of ſalt, an everlaſting covenant; not though he have communicated his name to them, which is an act of marriage; for to how many hath he ſaid: <hi>ego dixit Dii eſtis,</hi> I have ſaid you are Gods; and yet they have been reprobates; not all theſe outward things amount ſo far, as to make us diſcern who is this beloved perſon; for himſelf ſaies of the Iſraelites, to whom he had made all theſe demonſtrations of love, yet after, for their abominations, devorc'd himſelf from them, <hi>I have forſaken mine houſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 12.7.</note> 
               <hi>I have left mine own heritage, I have given the dearly beloved of my ſoul into the hands of her enemies.</hi> To conclude this perſon beloved of Chriſt, is only that ſoul, that loves Chriſt; but that belongs to the third branch of this firſt part, which is the mutual love:<note place="margin">The Affection.</note> but firſt having found the perſon, we are to conſider the affection it ſelf, the love of this text; it is an obſervation of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens,</hi> that though theſe three words, <hi>Amor, Dilectio,</hi> and <hi>Charitas,</hi> love, and affection, and good will, be all of one ſignification in the ſctiptures, yet ſaies he, whereſoever there is danger of repreſenting to the fancy a laſcivious and carnal love, the ſcripture forbears the word love, and uſes either affection, or good will; and where there is no ſuch danger, the ſcripture comes directly to this word love, of which <hi>Origens</hi> examples are, that when <hi>Iſaac</hi> bent his affections upon <hi>Rebecca,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> upon <hi>Rachel,</hi> in both places it is <hi>dilexit,</hi> and not <hi>amavit;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cant 5.8.</note> and when it is ſaid in the <hi>Cant. I charge you Daughters of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem to tell my well-beloved,</hi> it is not to tel him that ſhe was in love, but to tell him, <hi>quod vulneratae charitatis ſum;</hi> that I am wounded with an affection &amp; good will towards him; but in this book of <hi>Pro.</hi>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:93368:133"/>
in all the paſſages between Chriſt and the beloved ſoul, there is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more a free uſe of this word, <hi>Amor,</hi> love; becauſe it is even in the firſt apprehenſion, a pure, a chaſt, and an undefiled love, <hi>Eloquia Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis caſta,</hi> ſayes <hi>David,</hi> All the words of the Lord, and all their words that love the Lord, all diſcourſes, all that is ſpoken to or from the ſoul, is all full of chaſt love, and of the love of chaſtity.</p>
            <p>Now though this love of Chriſt to our ſouls be too large to ſhut up or comprehend in any definition, yet if we content our ſelves with the definition of the Schools, <hi>Amare eſt velle alicui quod bonum eſt,</hi> love is nothing but a deſire, that they whom we love ſhould be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py: we may eaſily diſcern the advantage and profit which we have by this love in the Text, when he that wiſhes us this good, by loving us, is author of all good himſelf, and may give us as much as pleaſes him, without impairing his own infinite treaſure; He loves us as his ancient inheritance, as the firſt amongſt his creatures in the creation of the world, which he created for us: He loves us more as his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, whom he hath bought with his blood; for even man takes moſt pleaſure in things of his own getting; But he loves us moſt for our improvement, when by his ploughing up of our hearts, and the dew of his grace, and the ſeed of his word, we come to give grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>s thus, and that in him, this love is <hi>velle bonum,</hi> a deſire that his beloved ſhould be happy, what ſoul amongſt us ſhall doubt, that when God hath ſuch an abundant, and infinite treaſure, as the merit and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt Jeſus, ſufficient to ſave millions of worlds, and yet, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny millions in this world (all the heathen excluded from any intereſt therein) when God hath a kingdome ſo large, as that nothing limits it, and yet he hath baniſhed many natural ſubjects thereof, even thoſe legions of Angels which were created in it, and are fallen from it; what ſoul amongſt us ſhall doubt, but that he that hath thus much, and loves thus much, will not deny her a portion in the blood of Chriſt or a room in the kingdome of heaven? No ſoul can doubt it except it have been a witneſs to it ſelf, and be ſo ſtill, that it love not Chriſt Jeſus, for that's a condition neceſſary: And that is the third branch to which we are come now in our order; that this love be mutuall, <hi>I love them, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>But this curſe determins not upon that, neither is it principally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected upon that, not loving; for as we ſay in the ſchools, <hi>Amor eſt primus actus voluntatis,</hi> the firſt thing that the will of man does, is to affect, to chooſe, to love ſomething; and it is ſcarce poſſible to find any mans will ſo idle, ſo barren, as that it hath produced no act at all; and therefore the firſt act being love, ſcarce any man can be found, that doth not love ſomething: But the curſes extends, yea is principally intended upon him that loves not Chriſt Jeſus; though he love the creature, and orderly enough yea; though he love God, as a great and incomprehenſible power, yet if he love not Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, if he acknowledg not, that all that paſſes between God and him, is in, and for Chriſt Jeſus, let him be accurſed, for all his love.</p>

            <p>And as this affection, love, doth belong to God principally, that is, rather then to any thing elſe, ſo doth it alſo principally, another way, that is, rather then any affection elſe; for, <hi>the fear of God is the beginning of wiſdom,</hi> but the love of God is the conſummation, that is, the marriage, and union of thy ſoul, and thy Saviour.</p>

To that purpoſe in that place, Chriſt, in the perſon of wiſdom, offers himſelfe to be found in the tops of high places, and in the gates of Cities; to ſhew that this Chriſt, and this wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which muſt ſave our Soules, is not confined to Cloyſters and Monaſteries, and ſpeculative men only, but is all ſo evidently and eminently to be found in the Courts of religious Princes, in the tops of high places, and in the Courts of Juſtice (in the gates of the City) Both theſe kinds of Courts may have more directions from him then other places; but yet in theſe places hee is alſo gloriouſly and conſpicuouſly to be found; for whereſoever he is, he cries aloud, as the Text ſaies there, and he utters his voyce.

            <p>WEE may conſider two great virtues, one for the ſociety of this life, Thankfulneſs, and the other for attaining the next life, Repentance; as the two pretious Mettles, Silver and Gold: Of Silver (of the virtue of thankfulneſs) there are whole Mines, books written by Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,

and a man may grow rich in that mettle,<note place="margin">Serm. 19.</note> in that virtue, by digging in that Mine, in the Precepts of moral men; of this Gold (this virtue of Repentance) there is no Mine in the Earth; in the books of Philoſophers, no doctrine of Repentance; this Gold is for the moſt part in the waſhes; this Repentance in matters of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation; but God directs thee to it in this Text, before thou come to thoſe waters of Tribulation, remember now thy Creator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe evill dayes come, and then thou wilt repent the not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring him till now.<note place="margin">Diviſio.</note> Here then the holy-Ghoſt takes the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt way to bring a man to God, by awaking his memory; for, for the underſtanding, that requires long and cleer inſtruction; and the will requires an inſtructed underſtanding before, and is in it ſelf the blindeſt and boldeſt faculty; but if the memory doe but faſten upon any of thoſe things which God hath done for us, it is the neereſt way to him. Remember therefore, and remember now, though the Memory be placed in the hindermaſt part of the brain, defer not thou thy remembring to the hindermoſt part of thy life, but doe that now <hi>in die,</hi> in the day, whil'ſt thou haſt light, now <hi>in diebus,</hi> in the days, whilſt God preſents thee many lights, many means; and <hi>in diebus juventatis,</hi> in the days of thy youth, of ſtrength, whilſt thou art able to doe that which thou purpoſeſt to thy ſelf; And as the word imports, <hi>Bechucocheica, in diebus E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectionum tuarum,</hi> in the dayes of thy choice, whilſt thou art able to make thy choyce, whilſt the Grace of God ſhines ſo bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon thee, as that thou maiſt chooſe the way, and ſo powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon thee, as that thou maiſt walke in that way.

Church of God: preſent that which belongs to the underſtanding, to that faculty, and the underſtanding is not preſently ſetled in it; preſent any of the prophecies made in the captivity, and a Jews un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding takes them for deliverances from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans underſtanding takes them for deliverances from ſin and death, by the Meſſias Chriſt Jeſus; preſent any of the prophecies of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation concerning Antichriſt, and a Papiſt will underſtand it of a ſingle, and momentane, and tranſitory man, that muſt laſt but three yeer and a half; and a Proteſtant may underſtand it of a ſucceſſion of men, that have laſted ſo 1000. yeers already: preſent but the name of Biſhop or of elder, out of the Acts of the Apoſtle, or their Epiſtles, and other men will take it for a name of equality, and parity, and we for a name and office of diſtinction in the Hierarchy of Gods Church. Thus it is in the underſtanding that's often perplexed; conſider the other faculty, the will of man, by thoſe bitterneſſes which have paſſed between the Jeſuits and the Dominicans, (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other things belonging to the will) whether the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of grace, offered to men alike diſpoſed, muſt neceſſarily work alike upon both their wills? And amongſt perſons neerer to us, whether that proportion of grace, which doth convert a man, might not have been reſiſted by perverſneſs of his will? By all theſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties we way ſee, how untractable, and untameable a faculty the wil of man is.

               <hi>I am the Lord thy God which brought thee out of the land of Egypt;</hi> He only preſents to their memory what he had done for them. And ſo in delivering the Goſpel in one principal ſeal thereof, the ſacrament of his body, he recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it only to their memory, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> This is the faculty that God deſires to work upon; And therefore if thine underſtanding cannot reconcile differences in all Churches, if thy will cannot ſubmit it ſelf to the ordinances of thine own Church, go to thine own memory; for as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> calls that the ſtomach of the ſoul, we may be bold to call it the Gallery of the ſoul, hang'd with ſo many, and ſo lively pictures of the goodneſs and mercies of thy God to thee, as that every one of them ſhall be a catachiſm to thee, to inſtruct thee in all thy duties to him for thoſe mercies: And as a well made, and well plac'd picture, looks alwayes upon him that looks upon it; ſo ſhall thy God look upon thee, whoſe memory is

thus contemplating him, and ſhine upon thine underſtanding, and rectifie thy will too. If thy memory cannot comprehend his mercy at large ſhewed to his whole Church, (as it is almoſt an incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible thing, that in ſo few yeers he made us of the Reformation, equall even in number to our adverſaries of the Roman Church,) If thy memory have not held that picture of our general deliverance from the Navy; (if that mercy be written in the water and in the ſands, where it was perform'd, and not in thy heart) if thou remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not our deliverance from that artificiall Hell, the Vault, (in which, though his inſtruments failed of their plot, they did not blow us up; yet the Devil goes forward with his plot, if ever he can blow out; if he can get that deliverance to be forgotten.) If theſe be too large pictures for thy gallery, for thy memory, yet every man hath a pocket picture about him, <hi>Emanuel,</hi> a boſome book, and if he will turn over but one leaf, and remember what God hath done for him even ſince yeſterday, he ſhall find even by that little branch a navigable river, to ſail into that great and endleſs Sea of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies towards him, from the beginning of his being.</p>

               <note place="margin">Nunc.</note>Do but remember, but remember now: Of his own wil begat he us with the word of truth,<note place="margin">Jam. 1.18.</note> that we ſhould be as the firſt fruits of his creatures: That as we conſecrate all his creatures to him, in a ſober, and religious uſe of them, ſo as the firſt fruits of all, we ſhould prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally conſecrate our ſelves to his ſervice betimes. Now there were three payments of firſt fruits appointed by God to the Jews: The firſt was, <hi>Primitiae Spicarum,</hi> of their Ears of Corn, and this was early about <hi>Eaſter;</hi> The ſecond was <hi>Primitiae panum,</hi> of Loaves of Bread, after their corn was converted to that uſe; and this, though it were not ſo ſoon, yet it was early too, about <hi>Whitſontide;</hi> The third was <hi>Primitiae frugum,</hi> of all their Fruits and Revenues; but this was very late in <hi>Autumn,</hi> at the fall of the leaf, in the end of the yeer. The two firſt of theſe, which were offered early, were offered partly to God, and partly to Man, to the Prieſt; but in the laſt, which came late, God had no part: He had his part in the corn, and in the loaves, but none in the latter fruits. Offer thy ſelf to God; firſt, as <hi>Primitias ſpicarum,</hi> (whether thou glean in the world, or bind up whole ſheaves, whether thy increaſe be by little and little, or apace;) And offer thy ſelf, as <hi>primitias panum,</hi> when thou haſt kneaded up riches, and honor, and favour in a ſetled and eſtabliſhed fortune) offer at thy <hi>Eaſter,</hi> whenſoever thou haſt any reſurrection, any ſenſe of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thy ſoul from the ſhadow of death; offer at thy Pentecoſt, when the holy Ghoſt viſits thee, and deſcends upon thee in a fiery tongue, and melts thy bowels by the power of his word; for if thou defer thy offering til thy fal, til thy winter, til thy death, howſoever they may be thy firſt fruits, becauſe they be the firſt that ever thou gaveſt yet they are ſuch, as are not acceptable to God; God hath no portion in them, if they be not offered til then; offer thy ſelf now; for that's an eaſie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt;
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:93368:139"/>
yea offer to thy ſelf now, that's more eaſie; <hi>Viximus mundo; vivamus reliquum nobis ipſis;</hi> Thus long we have ſerved the world;<note place="margin">Baſil.</note> let us ſerve our ſelves the reſt of our time, that is, the beſt part of our ſelves, our ſouls, <hi>Expectas ut febris te vocet ad poenitentiam?</hi> Hadſt thou rather a ſickneſs ſhould bring thee to God, than a ſermon?<note place="margin">Idem.</note> hadſt thou rather be beholden to a Phyſitian for thy ſalvation, than to a Preacher? thy buſineſs is to remember; ſtay not for thy laſt ſickneſs, which may be a Lethargy in which thou mayeſt forget thine own name, and his that gave thee the name of a Chriſtian, Chriſt Jeſus himſelf: thy buſineſs is to remember, and thy time is now; ſtay not till that Angel come which ſhall ſay and ſwear,<note place="margin">Apo. 10 6.</note> that time ſhall be no more.</p>

To him that travails by night a buſh ſeems a tree, and a tree ſeems a man, and a man a ſpirit; nothing hath the true ſhape to him; to him that repents by night, on his death-bed, neither his own ſins, nor the mercies of God have their true proportion. Fool, ſaies Chriſt, this night they will fetch away thy ſoul; but he neither tels him, who they be that ſhall fetch it, nor whether they ſhall carry it; he hath no light but lightnings; a ſodain flaſh of horror firſt, and then he goes into fire without light. <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid Deus nobis ignem pacavit? non, ſed Diabolo, et Angelis:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chryſosto.</note> did God ordain hell fire for us? no, but for the Devil, and his Angels.

God did not make the fire for us; but much leſs did he make us for that fire; that is, make us to damn us. But now the Judgment is given, <hi>Ite maledicti,</hi> go ye accurſed; but yet this is the way of Gods juſtice, and his proceeding, that his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not alwaies executed, though they be given. The Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Sentences of Medes and Perſians are irrevocable, but the Judgments and Sentences of God, if they be given, if they be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, they are not executed.

               <note place="margin">In Diebus.</note>For this circumſtance is enlarged; it is not <hi>in die,</hi> but <hi>in diebus,</hi> not in one, but in many dayes; for God affords us many dayes, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lights to ſee and remember him by. This remembrance of God is our regeneration, by which we are new creatures; and therefore we may conſider as many dayes in it, as in the firſt creation. The firſt day was the making of light; and our firſt day is the knowledg of him, who ſaies of himſelf, <hi>ego ſum lux mundi,</hi> I am the light of the world,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.</note> and of whom St. <hi>John</hi> teſtifies, <hi>Erat lux vera,</hi> he was the true light, that lighteth every man into the world. This is then our firſt day the true paſſion of Chriſt Jeſus. God made light firſt, that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures might be ſeen;<note place="margin">Ambro.</note> 
               <hi>Fruſtra eſſent ſi non viderentur,</hi> It had been to no purpoſe to have made creatures, if there had been no light to manifeſt them. Our firſt day is the light and love of the Goſpel; for the nobleſt creatures of Princes, (that is, the nobleſt actions of Princes, war, and peace, and treaties) <hi>fruſtra ſunt,</hi> they are good for nothing, they are nothing, if they be not ſhew'd and tried by this light, by the love and preſervation of the Goſpel of Chriſt Jeſus: God made light firſt, that his other works might appear, and he made light firſt, that himſelf (for our example) might do all his other works in the light: that we alſo, as we had that light ſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us in our baptiſm, ſo we might make all our future actions juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by that light, and not <hi>Erubeſcere Evangelium,</hi> not be aſhamed of being too jealous in this profeſſion of his truth. Then God ſaw that the light was good: the ſeeing implies a conſideration; that ſo a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion be not accepted blindly, nor implicitly; and the ſeeing it to be good implies an election of that religion, which is ſimply good in it ſelf, and not good by reaſon of advantage, or conveniency, or other collateral and by-reſpects. And when God had ſeen the light, and ſeen that it was good, then he ſevered light from darkneſs; and he ſevered them, <hi>non tanquam duo poſitiva,</hi> not as as two eſſential, and poſitive, and equal things; not ſo, as that a brighter and a darker re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, (a good and a bad) ſhould both have a beeing together, but <hi>tanquam poſitivum et primitivum,</hi> light and darkneſs are primitive, and poſitive, and figure this rather, that a true religion ſhould be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed, and continue, and darkneſs utterly removed; and then, and not till then, (till this was done, light ſevered from darkneſs) there was a day; And ſince God hath given us this day, the brightneſs of his Goſpel, that this light is firſt preſented, that is, all great actions begun with this conſideration of the Goſpel; ſince all other things are made by this light, that is, all have relation to the continuance of the Goſpel, ſince God hath given us ſuch a head, as is ſharp-ſighted in ſeeing the ſeveral lights, wiſe in diſcerning the true light, powerful in reſiſting forraign darkneſs; ſince God hath given

               <note place="margin">Serm. 20.</note> as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks of the dayes of Gods inſtitution, he that will not remember God now in this day, is impious to him; and unthankful to that great inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his, by whom this day ſpring from an high hath viſited us.</p>
            <p>To make ſhorter dayes of the reſt,<note place="margin">Levit. 23.</note> (for we muſt paſs through all the ſix dayes in a few minuts) God in the ſecond day made the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament to divide between the waters above, and the waters below; and this firmament in us, is <hi>terminus cognoſcibilium,</hi> the limits of thoſe things which God hath given man means and faculties to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and underſtand: he hath limited our eyes with a firmament beſet with ſtars, our eyes can ſee no farther: he hath limited our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in matters of religion with a ſtarry firmament too; that is, with the knowledg of thoſe things, <hi>quae ubique, quae ſemper,</hi> which thoſe ſtars which he hath kindled in his Church, the Fathers and Doctors, have ever from the beginning propoſed as things neceſſary to be explicitely believ'd, for the ſalvation of our ſouls; for the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal decrees of God, and his unreveal'd myſteries, and the inextrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perplexities of the School, they are waters above the firmament: here <hi>Paul</hi> plants, and here <hi>Apollo</hi> waters; here God raiſes up men to convey to us the dew of his grace, by waters under the firmament; by viſible ſacraments, and by the word ſo preach'd, and ſo interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as it hath been conſtantly, and unanimouſly from the beginning of the Church. And therefore this ſecond day is perfited in the third, in the <hi>congregentur aquae,</hi> let the waters be gathered together; God hath gathered all the waters, all the waters of life in one place; that is, all the doctrine neceſſary for the life to come, into his Church: And then <hi>producet terra,</hi> here in this world are produced to us all herbs and fruits, all that is neceſſary for the ſoul to feed upon. And in this third daies work God repeats here that teſtimony, <hi>videt quod bonum,</hi> he ſaw that it was good; good, that here ſhould be a gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of waters in one place, that is, no doctrine receiv'd that had not been taught in the Church; and <hi>videt quod bonum,</hi> he ſaw it was good, that all herbs and trees ſhould be produced that bore ſeed; all doctrines that were to be proſeminated and propagated, and to be continued to the end, ſhould be taught in the Church: but for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines which were but to vent the paſſion of vehement men, or to ſerve the turns of great men for a time, which were not ſeminal do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, doctrines that bore ſeed, and were to laſt from the beginning to the end; for theſe interlineary doctrines, and marginal, which were no part of the firſt text, here's no teſtimony that God ſees that they are good. And, <hi>In diebus iſtis,</hi> if in theſe two daies, the day when God makes thee a firmament, ſhewes thee what thou art, to limit thine underſtanding &amp; thy faith upon, and the day where God makes thee a ſea, a collection of the waters, (ſhowes thee where theſe neceſſary things muſt be taught in the Church) if in thoſe daies thou wilt not remember thy Creator, it is an irrecoverable Lethargy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:93368:141"/>In the fourth daies work, let the making of the Sun to rule the day be the teſtimony of Gods love to thee, in the ſun-ſhine of temporal proſperity, and the making of the Moon to ſhine by night, be the refreſhing of his comfortable promiſes in the darkneſs of adverſity; &amp; then remember that he can make thy ſun to ſet at noon, he can blow out thy taper of proſperity when it burns brighteſt,<note place="margin">Amos.</note> and he can turn the Moon into blood,<note place="margin">Act. 2.20.</note> he can make all the promiſes of the Goſpel, which ſhould comfort thee in adverſity, turn into deſpair and obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Let the firſt daies work, which was the creation <hi>Omnium reptibilium,</hi> and <hi>omnium volatilium,</hi> of all creeping things, and of all flying things, produc'd out of water, ſignifie and denote to thee, either thy humble devotion, in which thou ſaiſt of thy ſelf to God, <hi>vermis ege et non homo,</hi> I am a worm and no man; or let it be the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of thy ſoul in that, <hi>pennas columbae dediſti,</hi> that God hath given thee the wings of a dove to fly to the wilderneſs, in a retiring from, or a reſiſting of tentations of this world; remember ſtill that God can ſuffer even thy humility to ſtray, and degenerate into an uncomly dejection and ſtupidity, and ſenſeleſneſs of the true dignity and true liberty of a Chriſtian: and he can ſuffer this retiring thy ſelf from the world, to degenerate into a contempt and deſpiſing of others, and an overvaluing of thine own perfections. Let the laſt day in which both man and beaſts were made out of the earth, but yet a living ſoul breath'd into man; remember thee that this earth which treads upon thee, muſt return to that earth which thou treadſt upon; thy body, that loads thee, and oppreſſes thee to the grave, and thy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to him that gave it.

            <p>THere is not a more comprehenſive, a more embracing word in all Religion, then the firſt word of this Text, <hi>Now;</hi> for the word before that, <hi>For,</hi> is but a word of connexion, and rather appertains to that which was ſaid before the Text, then to the Text it ſelf: The Text begins with that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:93368:144"/>
and conſiderable particle, <hi>Now, Now is ſalvation nearer, &amp;c.</hi> This preſent word, <hi>Now,</hi> denotes an <hi>Advent,</hi> a new coming, or a new operation, otherwiſe then it was before: And therefore doth the Church appropriate this Scripture to the celebration of the <hi>Advent,</hi> before the Feaſt of the Birth of our Saviour. It is an extenſive word, <hi>Now;</hi> for though we diſpute whether this <hi>Now,</hi> that is, whether an inſtant be any part of time or no, yet in truth it is all time; for whatſoever is paſt, was, and whatſoever is future, ſhall be an inſtant; and did and ſhall fall within this <hi>Now.</hi> We conſider in the Church four <hi>Advents</hi> or Comings of Chriſt, of every one of which we may ſay <hi>Now,</hi> now it is otherwiſe then before: For firſt there is <hi>verbum in carne,</hi> the word came in the fleſh, in the Incarnation; and then there is <hi>caro in verbo,</hi> he that is made fleſh comes in the word, that is, Chriſt comes in the preaching thereof; and he comes again in <hi>carne ſaluta,</hi> when at our diſſolution and tranſmigration; at our death he comes by his ſpirit, and teſtifies to our ſpirit that we die the Children of God: And laſtly he comes in <hi>carne reddita,</hi> when he ſhall come at the Reſurrection, to redeliver our bodies to our ſouls, and to deliver everlaſting glory to both. The Ancients for the moſt part underſtand the word of our Text, of Chriſts firſt coming in the fleſh to us in this world; the latter Expoſition underſtand them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his coming in glory: But the Apoſtle could not properly uſe this preſent word <hi>Now,</hi> with relation to that which is not now, that is, to future glory, otherwiſe then as that future glory hath a preparation and an inchoation in preſent grace; for ſo even the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture glory of heaven hath a <hi>Now,</hi> now the elect Children of God have by his powerfull grace a preſent poſſeſſion of glory. So then it will not be impertinent to ſuffer this flowing and extenſive word <hi>Now</hi> to ſpread it ſelf into all three: for the whole duty of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity conſiſts in theſe three things; firſt <hi>in pietate erga Deum,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion towards God; in which the Apoſtle had enlarged himſelf from the beginning to the twelfth chapter of his Epiſtle: And ſecondly, <hi>in charitate erga proximum,</hi> in our mutual duties of ſociety towards our Equals and Inferiors, and of Subjection towards our Superiours, in which that twelfth chapter, and this to the eitghth verſe is eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially converſant: And then thirdly, <hi>in ſanctimonia propria,</hi> in the works of ſanctification and holineſs in our ſelves: And this Text the Apoſtle preſents as a forcible reaſon to induce us to that, to thoſe works of ſanctification, becauſe <hi>Now our ſalvation is nearer us then when we believed.</hi> Take then this <hi>now,</hi> the firſt way of the coming Chriſt in perſon, in the fleſh into this world; and then the Apoſtle of directs himſelf principally to the Jews converted to the faith of Chriſt, and he tels them, That their ſalvation is nearer them now, now they had ſeen him come, then when they did only believe that he would come: Take the words the ſecond way, of his coming in grace into our hearts; and ſo the Apoſtle directs himſelf to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:93368:144"/>
now, now that you have bin bred in the Chriſtian Church, now that you are grown from Grace to grace, from faith to faith, now that God by his ſpirit ſtrengthens and confirms you; <hi>now is your ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion nearer then when ye believed,</hi> that is, when you began to believe, either by the faith of your Parents, or the faith of the Church, or the faith of your Sureties at your Baptiſm; or when you began to have ſome notions, and impreſſions, and apprehenſions of faith in your ſelf, when you came to ſome degrees of underſtanding and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion: Take the word of Chriſts coming to us at the hour of death, or of his coming to us at the day of Judgment (for thoſe two are all one to our preſent purpoſe, becauſe God never reverſes any particular judgement given at a mans death at the day of the general Judgment:) take the word ſo, &amp; this is the Apoſtles argument, you have believed, and you have lived accordingly, and that faith, and that good life hath brought ſalvation nearer you, that is, given you a fair and modeſt infallibility of ſalvation, in the nature of reverſion; but now, now that you are come to the approches of death, which ſhall make your reverſion a poſſeſsion; <hi>Now is ſalvation nearer you then when you believed.</hi> Summarily, the Text is a reaſon why we ought to proceed in good and holy wayes; and it works in all the three acceptations of the word; for whether ſalvation be ſaid to be near us, becauſe we are Chriſtians, and ſo have advantage of the Jews, or near us, becauſe we have made ſome proficiency in holineſs &amp; ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctimony; or near us, becauſe we are near our end, and thereby near a poſſeſſion of our endleſs joy and glory: Still from all theſe accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the word ariſe religious provocations to perſeverance in holineſs of life; and therefore we ſhall purſue the words in all three acceptations.</p>
            <p>In all three acceptations we muſt conſider three termes in the Text; Firſt, <hi>Quid ſalus,</hi> what this Salvation is that is intended here;<note place="margin">Part. 1.</note> and then, <hi>Quid prope,</hi> what this Diſtance, this nearneſs is; and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Quid credere,</hi> what Belief this is. So then, taking the words firſt the firſt way, as ſpoken by the Apoſtles, to the Jews newly converted to the Chriſtian Faith, ſalvation is the outward means of ſalvation, which are more and more manifeſt to the Chriſtians, then they were to the Jews. And then the ſecond Term, Nearneſs (ſalvation is nearer) is in this, That ſalvation to the Chriſtian is in things preſent or paſt, in things already done, and of which we are experimentally ſure; but to the Jews it was of future things, of which, howſoever they might aſſure themſelves that they would be, yet they had no aſſurance when: And therefore (in the third place) their Believing was but a confident expectation, and faithfull aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Prophets; <hi>quando credidiſtis,</hi> when you believed, that is, when you did only believe, and ſaw nothing.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, the firſt Terme in the firſt acceptation, Salvation,<note place="margin">Salus.</note> is the outward means of ſalvation. Outward and viſible means of

               <hi>porro inexcuſabilis, Therefore art thou inexcuſable O man.</hi> The viſible God was preſented in viſible things, and thou mightſt, and wouldſt not ſee him: but this is only ſuch a knowledge of God as Philoſophers, moral and natural men may have, and yet be very farre from making this knowledge any means of ſalvation. A man that hath often travelled by that way where there ſtands a fair houſe will ſay, and ſay truly, that he knows that houſe; but yet he knows not the wayes that lead neareſt and faireſt to it, nor he knows not the lodgings and conveniencies of that houſe as he doth that hath been an often and welcome gueſt to it, or a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall dweller in it. Natural men by paſſing often through the contemplation of nature have ſuch a knowledge of God; but the knowledge which is to ſalvation, is by being in Gods houſe, in the Houſhold of the Faithfull, in the Communion of Saints, and by having ſuch a converſation in heaven in this life. That which our Saviour Chriſt ſayes, <hi>In domo Patris, In my Fathers houſe there are many Manſions,</hi> as it is intended principally of our ſtate of glory, and diverſity of degrees of that in heaven; ſo is it true alſo of Gods houſe at large, <hi>Multae manſiones.</hi> In Gods houſe, which is All (all this world, and the next too, is Gods houſe) there are out-houſes, rooms without the houſe; ſo conſidered in this world on the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils, and the Heathen, which are without the Church, and yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them God hath ſome Servants: ſo in his houſe there are women below ſtairs, that is, in his viſible Church here upon Earth; and women above ſtairs, that is, degrees of Glory in the triumphant Church. To them that are lodged in thoſe out-houſes, out of the Covenant out of the Church, ſalvation comes ſometimes, God doth ſave ſome of them: but yet is not near them, that is, they have no ordinary nor eſtabliſhed way of attaining to it, becauſe Chriſt is not manifeſted to them in an ordinary preaching of the Word, and an ordinary adminiſtration of the Sacraments. And then to them who are above ſtairs, that is in poſſeſſion of ſalvation in heaven, we cannot ſay ſalvation is nearer and nearer to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are already in an actuall poſſeſſion thereof. But to them who are in Gods Houſe, and yet below ſtairs; to them who have ſalvation preſented unto them by ſenſible and viſible means; to them their ſalvation is properly ſaid io be near. And ſuch a people God had from the beginning, and ſhall have to the end; and that people the Jewes were; and therefore their glory was juſt and true glory,<note place="margin">Deut. 41.7.</note> when they glorified themſelves in that, <hi>What Nation is ſo great?</hi> wherein conſiſted their greatneſs? that followes; <hi>Unto whom is the Lord ſo nigh as he is to us?</hi> and in what conſiſted this
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:93368:145"/>
nearneſs? in this; <hi>What Nation hath ordinances and lawes ſo righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as we have?</hi> Here then was their ſalvation; firſt God withdrew them from the nations; he naturaliz'd them, he denizend them into his own kingdom, <hi>ſub ſigillo circumciſionis,</hi> in the ſeal of their blood in circumciſion, he gave them an intereſt in his blood to be ſhed in his paſſion: and then, this was their farther ſalvation, that when he had thus taken them into his ſervice, &amp; put them into his livery, a livery of his own color, of blood in their circumciſion, then he gave them a particular law for all their actions, how they ſhould live in his favour; and he gave them a particular form of outward religious worſhip, which ſhould be acceptable to him; the law, which was a ſenſible rule of their life, and their ſacrifices, which were the ſenſible rule of their religion, was ſalvation: <hi>non taliter,</hi> ſaies <hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſa. 147.9.</note> God hath not dealt ſo with other nations; for though God from other nations do here and there pick out a ſervant, yet he hath not given other nations ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that is, ſetled an ordinary means of ſalvation amongſt them. That was true of the Jews, and will alwaies be true of the whole Church of God, which <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaies, <hi>quia nec oculis perſpicitur, nec manibus palpatur ſpiritualis gratia,</hi> becauſe the grace of God it ſelf cannot be diſcerned by the eye, nor diſtinguiſhed by the touch, <hi>non poſſumus niſi externis ſignis adjuti, ſtatuere Deum nobis eſſe propitium,</hi> we could not aſſure our ſelves of the mercies of God, if we had not outward and ſenſible ſigns and ſeals of thoſe mercies; and therefore God never left his Church without ſuch external and viſible means and ſeals of grace. And though all thoſe means were not properly ſeals, (for that is proper to ſacraments, as a ſacrament is ſtrictly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to be a ſeal of grace) yet the Fathers did often call many of theſe things by that name ſacraments, becauſe they had ſo much of the nature of a true ſacrament, as that they advanc'd and furthered the working of grace.

ſalutis,</hi> ſalvation is means of ſalvation; and the next is the <hi>propè,</hi> wherein theſe means and helps were nearer to the Jews, after they were converted to the Chriſtian religion, then before: and we conſider them juſtly, to have been nearer, that is, more diſcernabl; firſt, <hi>quia plura,</hi> becauſe the helps of the Chriſtians are more; and then, <hi>quia potiora,</hi> becauſe in their nature they are better; and laſtly, <hi>quia manifeſtiora,</hi> becauſe they have a better evidence towards us; for ſo as the more bodies are together, the greater the object is, and ſo made the more viſible; ſo they are nearer, <hi>quia plura,</hi> becauſe they are more; and ſo, as the more beautiful, and better proportioned a body is, the more it draws the eye to look upon it; ſo they are nearer, <hi>quia potiora,</hi> becauſe they are better; and ſo as the more evidence, and light and luſtre they have in themſelves, the eaſier things are diſcerned, ſo they are nearer,<note place="margin">Plura.</note> 
               <hi>quia manifeſtiora,</hi> becauſe they are more viſible. Firſt, how there ſhould be more helps in the Chriſtian religion, then in the Jewiſh, is not ſo evident at firſt: for firſt, if we conſider the law to be ſalvation, they had a vaſt multiplicity of laws, ſcarſe leſs then 600 ſeveral laws; whereas the honor of the Chriſtian religion is, that it is <hi>verbum abbreviatum,</hi> an abridgment of all into ten words, as <hi>Moſes</hi> cals the Commandements; and then a re-abridgment of that abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into two, love God, and love thy Neighbour, that is, faith and works. If we conſider their laws to be their ſalvation, they had more; and if we conſider their ſacrifices to be their ſalvation, they had more too; for their Rabbins obſerve at leaſt 50 ſeveral kinds of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting uncleaneſs, to which there were appropriated ſeveral expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſacrifices; whereas we have only the ſacrifices of prayer, and of praiſe, and of Chriſt in the ſacrament; for ſo it is, the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry phraſe &amp; manner of ſpeech in the Fathers to call that a ſacrifice; not only as it is a commemorative ſacrifice, (for that is amongſt our ſelves, and ſo every perſon in the congregation may ſacrifice, that is, do that in remembrance of Chriſt,) but as it is a real ſacrifice, in which the Prieſt doth that, which none but he does; that is, really to offer up Chriſt Jeſus crucified to Almighty God for the ſins of the people, ſo, as that that very body of Chriſt, which offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for a propitiatory ſacrifice upon the croſs, once for all, that body, and all that that body ſuffered, is offered again, and preſented to the Father, &amp; the Father is intreated, that for the merits of that perſon, ſo preſented and offered unto him; and in contemplation thereof, he will be merciful to that congregation, and applie thoſe merits of his, to their particular ſouls. Theſe are our ſacrifices, prayer and praiſe, and Chriſt thus offered; and how are theſe more then the Jews had? they had more laws, and more ſacrifices, and as many ſacraments as we; and if nearneſs of ſalvation conſiſt in the plurality of theſe, how is ſalvation nearer to us then to them, <hi>quatenus plura,</hi> in that firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects as the means are more, as it is truly and properly ſaid, that there are more ingredients, more ſimples, more means of reſtoring in our dram of triacle or mithridate, then in an ounce of any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

ſyrup, in which there may be 3 or 4 in the other, perchance ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred; ſo in that receit of our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>quicquid ligave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris;</hi> in the abſolution, of the Miniſter, that whatſoever he ſhall bind or looſe upon earth, ſhall be bound or looſe in heaven; there is more phyſick, then in all the expiations and ſacrifices of the old law. There an expiation would ſerve to day, which would not ſerve to morrow; if it were omitted till the ſun were ſet upon it, it required a more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere expiation: and ſo alſo an expiation would ſerve for one tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, which would not ſerve for another; but here, in the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the Miniſter, there is a concurrence, a confluence of mede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines of all qualities; purgative in confeſſion, and reſtorative in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; coraſive in the preaching of Judgments, and cordial in the balm of the ſacrament: here is no limitation of time, at what time ſoever a ſinner repenteth, nor limitation of ſins, whatſoever is forgiven in earth is forgiven in heaven: ſalvation is nearer us in this reſpect, that we have <hi>plura adminicula,</hi> more outward and viſible means then the Jews had, becauſe we may receive more in one action, then they could in all theirs.</p>
            <p>It is ſo alſo, not only <hi>quia plura,</hi> becauſe we have more means,<note place="margin">Potiora.</note> but <hi>quia potiora,</hi> becauſe thoſe means which we have are in their nature better, more attractive, and more winning. The means, (as we have ſaid before) were their laws, and their ſacrifices, and their ſacraments, and for their law, it was <hi>lex interficiens, non perficiens;</hi> it was a law,<note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> that puniſhed unrighteouſneſs, but it did not confer righteouſneſs: and their ſacrifices, being in blood, (if we remove from them their ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical ſignification, and what they prefigured, which was the ſhedding of the blood of the lamb which takes away the ſins of the world) muſt neceſſarily create and excite a natural horror in man, and an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs from them. Take their ſacraments into compariſon, and then one of their ſacraments, Circumciſion, was limited to one ſex, it reached not to women; and their other ſacrament, the paſſover, was in the primary ſignification and inſtitution thereof, only a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulatory commemoration of a temporal benefit of their deliverance from <hi>Egypt.</hi> And therefore to conſtitute a judgment proportionably by the effects, we ſee the law, and the ſacrifice, and the ſacraments of thy Jews, did not much work upon foraign Nations; it was ſalvation, but ſalvation ſhut up amongſt themſelves; whereas we ſee that the law of the Chrſtians, which is, to conforme our ſelves to our great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and pattern, Chriſt Jeſus, who, (if we would conſider him meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as man) was the moſt exemplar man, for all Theological vertues, &amp; moral too, that ever any hiſtory preſented; &amp; the ſacrifices of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which are all ſpiritual, &amp; therein more proportional to God who is all ſpirit; and the ſacraments of Chriſtians, in which, though not <hi>ex opere operator,</hi> not becauſe that action is performed, not becauſe that ſacrament is adminiſtred, yet <hi>ex pacto,</hi> and <hi>quando opus operamur:</hi> by Gods covenant, when ſoever that action is performed, whenſoever
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:93368:147"/>
that ſacrament is adminiſtred, the grace of God is exhibited and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered; <hi>nec fallaciter,</hi> as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaies well, it is offered with a purpoſe on Gods part, that that grace ſhould be accepted, we ſee, I ſay that theſe laws, and theſe ſacrifices, and theſe ſacraments have gain'd upon the whole world; for in their nature, and in their attractiveneſs, and in their applyableneſs, and ſo in their effect, they are <hi>potiora,</hi> better, and in that reſpect, ſalvation is nearer us then it was to the Jews.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Manifeſtiora.</note>And ſo it is, laſtly, <hi>quia manifeſtiora,</hi> becauſe they have an evidence and manifeſtation of themſelves, in themſelves. Now, this is eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially true in the ſacraments, becauſe the ſacraments exhibit and convey grace; and grace is ſuch a light, ſuch a torch, ſuch a beacon, as where it is, it is eaſily ſeen. As there is a luſtre in a precious ſtone, which no mans eye or finger can limit to a certain place or point in that ſtone, ſo though we do not aſſign in the ſacrament, where, that is, in what circumſtance or part of that holy action grace is; or when, or how it enters, (for though the word of conſecration alter the bread, not to another thing, but to another uſe; and though they leave it bread, yet they make it other bread, yet the enunciation of thoſe words doth not infuſe nor imprint this grace, which we ſpeak of, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that bread) yet whoſoever receives this ſacrament worthily, ſees evidently an entrance, and a growth of grace in himſelf. But this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which we ſpeaks of this manifeſtation, is not only, (though eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially) in the ſacraments, but in other ſacramental and ceremonial things, which God (as he ſpeaks by his Church) hath ordained, as the croſs in baptiſm, and adoration at the ſacrament (I do not ſay, I am far from ſaying, adoration of the ſacrament; there is a fair diſtance and a ſpacious latitude between thoſe two, an adoring of God in a devout humiliation of the body in that holy action, and an adoring the bread, out of a falſe imagination that that bread is God: A rectifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man may be very humble and devout in that action, and yet a great way on this ſide the ſuperſtition and Idolatry in the practiſe of the Roman Church) in theſe ſacramental and ritual, and ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al things, which are the bellows of devotion, and the ſubſidies of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and which were alwaies in all Churches, there is a more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent manifeſtation and clearneſs in theſe things in the Chriſtian Church, then was amongſt the Jews in the ceremonial parts of their religion, becauſe almoſt all ours have reference to that which is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy done and accompliſhed, and not to things of a future expectation, as thoſe of the Jews were: So you know the paſſover of the Jews, had a relation to their comming out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> that was paſt, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by obvious to every mans apprehenſion; every man that eat the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over; remembered their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> but then the paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over had alſo relation to that lamb which was to redeem that world; &amp; this was a future thing; and this certainly very few amongſt them underſtood, or conſidered upon that occaſion, that as thy lamb is kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led here, ſo there ſhall be a lamb killed for all the world hereafter.

Now, our actions in the Church, do moſt reſpect things formerly done, and ſo they awaken, and work upon our memory, which is an eaſier faculty to work upon, then the underſtanding or the will. Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is nearer us, in theſe outward helps, becauſe their ſignification is clearer to us, and more apprehenſible by us, being of things paſt,<note place="margin">Credidistis.</note> and accompliſhed already. So then the Apoſtle might well ſay that ſalvation, that is, outward means of ſalvation, was nearer, that is, more in number, better in uſe, clearer in evidence then it was before; <hi>quando crediderunt,</hi> when they believed, which is the third and laſt term, in this firſt acceptation of the word. Salvation was brought into the world, in the firſt promiſe of a Meſſias in the ſemen contract, <hi>That the ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe the ſerpents head;</hi> and it was brought nearer, when this Miſſias was fixed in <hi>Abrahams</hi> race, <hi>in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine tuo In thy ſeed ſhall all nations be bleſſed;</hi> it was brought nearer then that, when it was brought from <hi>Abrahams</hi> race to <hi>Davids</hi> fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>in ſolio tuo, The ſcepter ſhall not depart from thee, till he come;</hi> and ſtill nearer, <hi>in Eſaias virgo concipiet</hi> when ſo particular mark was ſet upon the Meſſias as that he ſhould be the ſon of a virgin; and yet nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer <hi>in Micheas, &amp; tu Bethlem,</hi> that <hi>Bethlem</hi> was deſign'd for the place of his birth; and nearer in <hi>Daniels</hi> 70 weeks, when the time was manifeſted. And though it were nearer then all this, when <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi> came to ſay <hi>Repent for the Kingdome of God is at hand,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 3.2.</note> yet it was truly very near, neareſt of all, when Chriſt came to ſay,<note place="margin">Luc. 17.21.</note> 
               <hi>Behold the Kingdom of God is amongſt you;</hi> for all the reſt were in the <hi>crediderunt,</hi> he was nearer them becauſe they believed he would come; but then it was brought to the <hi>viderunt,</hi> they ſaw he was come.<note place="margin">Joh. 20.29.</note> 
               <hi>Beati</hi> ſaies Chriſt: <hi>Bleſſed are they that have believed, and have not ſeen:</hi> they had ſalvation brought nearer unto them by their believing; but yet Chriſt ſpeaks of another manner of bleſſedneſs conferred upon his Diſciples, <hi>Bleſſed are your eyes for they ſee, and your ears for they hear;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 13.16.</note> 
               <hi>for, verily I ſay unto you, that many Prophets &amp; Righteous men, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſee the things which ye ſee, and have not ſeen them.</hi> To end this, the belief of the Patriarks was bleſſedneſs;<note place="margin">Joh. 8.56.</note> and it was a kind of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too; for ſo Chriſt ſaies <hi>your Father Abraham rejoyced to ſee my day, and he ſaw it;</hi> but this was a ſeeing with the eye of faith which diſcovers future things; but Chriſt prefers the bleſſedneſs of the Diſciples, becauſe they ſaw things preſent and already done. All our life is a paſſing bell, but then was <hi>Simeon</hi> content his bell ſhould ring out, when his eyes had ſeen his ſalvtion. In that eſpecially doth St. <hi>John</hi> exalt the force of his argument; <hi>quae vidimus:</hi>

               <hi>That which we have ſeen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the word of life, that declare we unto you.</hi> Here is then the ineſtimable prerogative of the Chriſtian religion, it is grounded ſo far upon things which were ſeen to be done; it is brought ſo far from matter of faith, to matter of fact; from prophecy to hiſtory; from what the Meſſias ſhould do, to what he hath done; and that
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:93368:148"/>
was their caſe to whom this Apoſtle ſpake theſe wodrs, as we take them in the firſt acceptation; ſalvation, that is, outward means of ſalvation in the Church is nearer, that is, more and better and clearer to you now, that is, when you have ſeen Chriſtin the fleſh, then when you prefigured him in your law, or ſacrifices, or ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or believed him in your Prophets.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Second part.</note>In a ſecond ſence we took theſe words, of Chriſts ſecond <hi>Advent,</hi> or comming, his comming to our heart, in the working of his grace; And ſo the Apoſtles words are directed to all Chriſtians, and not only to the new convertits of that nation; and ſo theſe three terms, ſalvation, nearneſs, and believing, (which we propoſed to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in all the three acceptations of the words) will have this ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification. Salvation is the inward means of ſalvation, the working of the ſpirit, that ſets a ſeal to the eternal means: the <hi>prope,</hi> the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs lies in this, that this grace which is this ſalvation in this ſenſe, grows out of that which is in you already; not out of any thing which is in you naturally, but Gods firſt graces that are in you, grows into more and more grace. Grace does not grow out of nature; for nature in the higheſt exaltation and rectifying thereof cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce grace. Corn does not grow out of the earth, it muſt be ſowd; but corn grows only in the earth; nature, and naturall reaſon do not produce grace, but yet grace can take root in no other thing but in the nature and reaſon of man; whether we conſider Gods ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent graces, which grow out of his firſt grace, formerly given to us, and well employed by us, or his firſt grace, which works upon our natural faculties, and grows there; ſtill this ſalvation, that is, this grace is near us, for it is within us; &amp; then the third term believing, is either, <hi>quando credidiſtis primum,</hi> when you began to believe, either in an imputative belief of others in your baptiſm, or a faint belief, upon your firſt Catechiſings and Inſtruſtions; or <hi>quando credidiſtis tantum,</hi> when you only profeſſed a belief, or faith, and did nothing in decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of that faith, to the edification of others.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Salus.</note>Firſt then ſalvation in this ſecond ſenſe, is the internal operation of the holy Ghoſt, in infuſing grace: for therefore doth St. <hi>Baſil</hi> call the holy Ghoſt <hi>verbum Dei,</hi> the word of God, (which is the name properly peculiar to the Son) <hi>quia interpres filii, ſicut filius patris;</hi> that as the Father had revealed his will in the Prophets, and then the Son comes and interprets all that actually; this prophecy is meant of my coming, this of my dying, and ſo makes a real comment, and an actual interpretation of all the prophecies; for he does come, and he does die accordingly; ſo the holy Ghoſt comes, and comments upon this comment, interprets this interpretation, and tels thy ſoul that all this that the Father had promiſed, and the Son had perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, was intended by them, and by the working of their ſpirit, is now appropriated to thy particular ſoul. In the conſtitution and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a natural man, the body is not the man, nor the ſoul is not the

man, but the union of theſe two makes up the man; the ſpirits in a man which are the thin and active part of the blood, and ſo are of a kind of middle nature, between ſoul and body, thoſe ſpirits are able to doe, and they doe the office, to unite and apply the faculties of the ſoul to the organs of the body, and ſo there is a man: ſo in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man, a Chriſtian man, his being born of Chriſtian Parents, that gives him a body, that makes him of the body of the Covenant, it gives him a title, an intereſt in the Covenant, which is <hi>jus ad rem;</hi> thereby he may make his claim to the ſeal of the Covenant, to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and it cannot be denied him: and then in his baptiſm, that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment gives him a ſoul, a ſpiritual ſeal, <hi>jus in re,</hi> an actual poſſeſſion of Grace; but yet, as there are ſpirits in us, which unite body and ſoul, ſo there muſt be ſubſequent acts, and works of the bleſſed ſpirit, that muſt unite and confirm all, and make up this ſpiritual man in the wayes of ſanctification; for without that his body, that is, his being born within the Covenant, and his ſoul, that is, his having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Grace in baptiſm, do not make him up. This Grace is this Salvation; and when this Grace works powerfully in thee, in the wayes of ſanctification, then is this Salvation neer thee; which is our ſecond term in this ſecond acceptation, <hi>propè,</hi> neer.</p>

Virgin ſpeaks, <hi>Thy ſoul ſhall magnifie the Lord;</hi> all thy natural faculties ſhall be employed upon an aſſent to the Goſpel, thou ſhalt be able to prove it to thy ſelf, and to prove it to others, to be the Goſpel of Salvation: And then <hi>Exultabit ſpiritus,</hi> Thy ſpirit ſhall rejoyce in God thy Saviour, becauſe by the farther ſeal of ſanctification, thy ſpirit ſhall receive te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony from the ſpirit; that as Chriſt is <hi>Idem homo cum te,</hi> the ſame man that thou art, ſo thou art <hi>Idem ſpiritus cum Domino,</hi> the ſame ſpirit that he is; ſo far, as that as a ſpirit cannot be ſeparated in it ſelf, ſo neither canſt thou be ſeparated from God in Chriſt; And this,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:93368:149"/>
this exaltation of Grace, when it thus growes up to this height of ſanctification, is that neerneſs, which brings Salvation farther than our believing does? and that's the laſt term in this part; Believing.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Credidiſtis.</note>Now, neerer then Believing, neerer than Faith, a man might well think nothing can bring Salvation; for Faith is the hand that reaches it, and takes hold of it. But yet, as though our bodily hand reach to our temporal food, yet the mouth and the ſtomach muſt do their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice too; and ſo that meat muſt be diſtributed into all parts of the body, and aſſimilated to them; ſo though our faith draw this ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion neer us, yet when our mouth is imployed, that we have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to glorifie God in our diſcourſes, and to declare his wonderfull works to the ſons of men, in our thankfulneſs: And when this faith of ours is diſtributed over all the body, that the body of Chriſts Church is edified, and alienated by our good life and ſanctification, then is this Salvation neerer us, that is, ſafelier ſeal'd to us, then when we believed only.</p>
            <p>Either then, this <hi>quando credidiſtis,</hi> when you believed, may be refer'd to Infants, or to the firſt faith, and the firſt degrees thereof in men. In Infants, when that ſeminall faith, or potentiall faith, which is by ſome conceived to be in the Infants of Chriſtian parents at their baptiſm; or that actuall faith, which from their parents, or from the Church, is thought to be applyed to them, accepted in their behalf, in that Sacrament, when this faith growes up after, by this new comming of Chriſt in the power of his Grace and his Spirit, to be a lively faith, expreſſed in charity; then <hi>Salus proprior,</hi> then is Salvation neerer than when they believed; whether this belief were their own, or their parents, or the Churches, we have no ground to deny, that Salvation is neer, and preſent to all children rightly bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; but, for thoſe who have made ſure their Salvation by a good uſe of Gods graces after, we have another fair peece of evidence, that Salvation is neerer them. It is ſo to, if this believing be refer'd to our firſt elements and beginnings of faith: A man believes the hiſtory of Chriſt, becauſe it is matter of fact, and a ſtory probable, and well teſtified: A man may believe the Chriſtian Religion, or the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion for his eaſe, either becauſe he cannot or will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate controverſies, and reconcile differences, or becauſe he ſees it beſt for order and quiet, and civll ends, which he hath in that ſtate where he lives. Theſe be kinds of faith and morall aſſents: and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when a man is come thus far, to a hiſtorical and a moral faith, God ſuper-infuſes true faith; for howſoever he wrought by reaſon, and natural faculties, and moral, and civil wayes, yet it was God that wrought from the beginning, and produced this faith, though but hiſtorical or moral. And then, if God do exalt this moral or hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical faith farther then ſo, to believe not only the Hiſtory, but the Goſpel; not only that ſuch a Chriſt lived, and did thoſe miracles, and dyed, but that he was the Son of God, and dyed for the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:93368:149"/>
of the world; this brings Salvation neerer him, than when he believed; but then, when this grace comes to appropriate Chriſt to him, and more than that, to annunciate Chriſt by him, when it makes him (as <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was) <hi>a burning and a ſhining lamp;</hi> That Chriſt is ſhewed to him, and by him to others in a holy life, <hi>Then is Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion neerer him than when he believed,</hi> either as it is <hi>credidit pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,</hi> when he began to believe, but had ſome ſcruples, or <hi>credidit tantum,</hi> that he laid all upon faith, but had no care of works. To end this, this neerneſs of Salvation, is that union with God, which may be had in this life: It is the peace of conſcience, the undoubting truſt and aſſurance of Salvation. This aſſurance (ſo far as they will confeſs it may be had) the Roman Church places in faith, and ſo far, well, but then, <hi>In fide formata;</hi> and ſo far well enough too; In thoſe works which declare and teſtifie that faith; for, though this good work do nothing toward my Salvation, it does much towards this neerneſs, that is, towards my aſſurance of this Salvation; but herein they lead us out of the way, that they call theſe works the ſoul, the form of faith: for, though a good tree cannot be without good fruits, yet it were a ſtrange manner of ſpeech to call that good fruit, the life or the ſoul, or the form of that tree; ſo is it, to call works which are the fruits of faith, the life or ſoul, or form of faith; for that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to grace only which infuſes faith. They would acknowledge this neerneſs of ſalvation, this aſſurance in good works; but ſay they, man cannot be ſure, that their works is good, and therefore they can have no ſuch aſſurance. They who undertook the reformation of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in our Fathers dayes, obſerving that there was no peace without this aſſurance, expreſſed this aſſurance thus, That when a man is ſure that he believes aright, that he hath no ſcruples of God, no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God, and uſes all endeavors to continue it, and to expreſs it in his life, as long as he continues ſo, he is ſure of Salvation; and farther they went not: And then there aroſe men, which would reform the Reformers, and refine Salvation and bring it into a leſſe room; They would take away the condition, if you hold faſt, if you expreſs it; and ſo came up roundly and preſently to that; If ever you did believe, if ever you had faith, you are ſafe for ever, and upon that aſſurance you may reſt. Now I make no doubt, but that both theſe ſought the truth, that truth which concerns us, peace and aſſurance; and I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute not their reſolutions now; only I ſay, for theſe words which we have in hand now there is a conditional aſſurance implyed in them; for when it is ſaid now, now that you are in this ſtate, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is neer you: thus much is pugnantly intimated, that if you were not in this ſtate, Salvation were farther removed from you how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you pretend to believe.</p>
            <p>Now this hath brought us to our third and laſt ſenſe and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe words, as they are ſpoken of Chriſts laſt comming,<note place="margin">3 Part.</note> his comming in glory; which is to us at our deaths, and that judgment
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:93368:150"/>
which we receive then. And in this acceptation of the word, theſe three terms, Salvation, Neerneſs and Believing, are thus to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood: Salvation is Salvation perfected, conſummated; Salvation which was brought neer baptiſm, &amp; neerer in outward holyneſs, muſt be brought neerer than that: And this <hi>prope,</hi> this neerneſs is, that now being neer death, you are neer the laſt ſeal of your perſeverance; and ſo the <hi>credidiſtis,</hi> the believing amounts to this: though you have believed and liv'd accordingly, believed with the belief of a Jew, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved all the Prophets, and with the beliefe of a Chriſtian, believed all the Goſpel, believed with a ſeminal belief of your own, or an actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all belief of others at your baptiſm, with a hiſtorical belief, and with an Evangelical belief too, with a belief in your root, in the heart, and a belief in the fruits, expreſſed in a good life too, yet there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance and a perſeverance that muſt crown all this; and becauſe that cannot be diſcern'd till thine end, then only is it ſafely pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, <hi>Now is Salvation neerer you than when you believed.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Heb. 4.9.</note> ſayes the Apoſtle; they were the people of God before, and yet there remained a reſt, which they had not yet; not that there is not a bleſſed degree of reſt, in the <hi>Credidi,</hi> a happy aſſurance in the ſtrength of faith here, but yet there remaineth a reſt better than that; And therefore ſayes that Apoſtle there, <hi>Let us labor to enter into that reſt;</hi> as though we have reſt in our conſciences all the ſix dayes of the week, if we do the works of our callings ſincerely, yet all that while we labor; and there remains a Sabbath, which we have not all the week; ſo though we have peace and reſt in the teſtimony of our faith and obedience in this life, yet there remains a reſt, a Sabbath,

To conclude all with the force of the Apoſtles argument, in urging the words of this text, ſince God hath brought ſalvation nearer to you, then to them that believed; nearer to you in the Goſpel, when you have ſeen Chriſt come there to the Jews in the Prophets, where they only read that he ſhould come, and nearer to you, then where you believed, either ſeminally &amp; potentially, and imputatively at our baptiſm, or actually, and declaratorily in ſome parts of your life, by having perſiſted therein thus far; and ſince he is now bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it nearer to you, then when you believed at beſt, becauſe your end grows nearer,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12.</note> now, <hi>whilſt the evill daies come not, nor the year ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, wherein thou ſhalt ſay, I have no pleaſure in them;</hi> before the grinders ceaſe, becauſe they are few, and they wax dark, that look out at the windows, before thou go to the houſe of thine age, and the mourners go about in the ſtreets, prepare thy ſelf by caſting off thy ſins, and all that is gotten by thy ſins: for, as the plague is got as ſoon in linings, as in the outſide of a garment, ſalvation is loſt, as far, by retaining ill gotten goods, as by ill getting, forget not thy paſt ſins ſo far, as not to repent them; but remember not thy repented ſins ſo far, as to delight in remembring them, or to doubt that God hath not fully forgiven them; and whether God have brought this ſalvation near thee, by ſickneſs, or by age, or by general dangers, put off the conſideration of the incomodies of that age, or that ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that danger, and fill thy ſelf with the conſideration of the nearneſs of thy ſalvation, which that age, and ſickneſs, and danger, miniſter to thee: that ſo, when the beſt Inſtrument, and the beſt ſong ſhall meet together, thy bell ſhall towl, and thy ſoul ſhall hear that voice, <hi>Ecce ſalvator,</hi> behold thy Saviour cometh, thou maiſt bear a part, and chearfully make up that muſick, with a <hi>veni Domine Jeſu,</hi> Come Lord Jeſu, come quickly, come now.</p>

            <p>GOd intended life and immortality for man; and man by ſin induc'd death upon himſelf at firſt: When man had done ſo, and that now man was condemned, man muſt die; yet yet God gave him, though not an abſolute pardon, yet a long reprieve; though not a new immortality, yet a life of ſeven and eight hundred years upon earth: And then, miſery, by ſin growing upon man, and this long life which was enlarged in his favour being become a burden unto him, God abridged and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted his ſeven hundred to ſeventy, and his eight hundred to eighty years, the years of his life came to be threeſcore and ten; and if miſery do ſuffer him to exceed thoſe, even the exceeding it ſelf is miſery. Death then is from our ſelves, it is our own; but the executioner is from God, it is his, he gives life; no man can quicken his own ſoul, but any man can forfeit his own ſoul: And yet when he hath done ſo, he may not be his own executioner; for as God giveth life, ſo he killeth, ſays <hi>Moſes</hi> there: not as the cauſe of death, for death is not his creature; but becauſe he employs what perſon he will, and executes by what inſtrument it pleaſes him to chuſe, age or ſickneſs, or juſtice, or malice, or (in our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion) fortune. In that Hiſtory from whence we deduce this Text, which was that great execution, the ſodain death of all the firſt-born of <hi>Egypt;</hi> it is very large, and yet we may uſefully, and to good purpoſe enlarge it, if we take into our conſideration ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual death, as well as bodily: for ſo in our houſes from whence we came hither, if we left but a ſervant, but a child in the cradle at home, there is one dead in that houſe. If we have no other houſe but this which we carry about us, this houſe of clay, this tabernacle of fleſh, this body, yet if we conſider the inmate, the ſojourner within
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:93368:152"/>
this houſe,<note place="margin">Serm. 21.</note> the ſtate of our corrupt and putrified ſoul, there is one dead in this houſe too. And though we be met now in the Houſe of God, and our God be the God of Life, yet even in this houſe of the God of Life, and the ground enwrapped in the ſame conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; not only of every ſuch houſe, but let every mans length in the houſe be a houſe; of every ſuch ſpace this Text will be verified, <hi>There is not a houſe where there is not one dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God is abundant in his mercies to man, and as though he did but learn to give by his giving, as though he did but practiſe to make himſelf perfect in his own Art, which Art is bountiful Mercy; as though all his former bleſſings were but in the way of earneſt, and not of payment; as though every benefit that he gave, were a new obligation upon him, and not an acquittance to him; he delights to give where he hath given, as though his former gifts were but his places of memory, and marks ſet upon certain men, to whom he was to give more. It is not ſo good a plea in our prayers to God, for temporal or for ſpiritual bleſſings, to ſay, <hi>Have mercy upon me now, for I have loved thee heretofore,</hi> as to ſay, <hi>Have mercy upon me, for thou haſt loved me heretofore.</hi> We anſwer a Beggar, I gave you but yeſterday; but God therefore gives us to day, becauſe he gave us yeſterday: and therefore are all his bleſſings wrap'd up in that word, <hi>Panis quotidianus, Give us this day our daily bread:</hi> Every day he gives; and early every day; his Manna falls before the Sun riſes, and his mercies are new every morning. In this conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his abounding in all ways of mercy to us, we conſider juſtly how abundant he is in inſtructing us. He writes his Law once in our hearts, and then he repeats that Law, and declares that Law again in his written Word, in his Scriptures. He writes his Law in ſtone-Tables once; and then thoſe Tables being broken, he repeats that Law, writes that Law again in other Tables. He gives us his Law in <hi>Exodus</hi> and <hi>Leviticus,</hi> and then he gives us a <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> a repetition of that Law, another time in another Book. And as he abounds ſo in inſtructing us, in going the ſame way twice over towards us, as he gives us the Law a ſecond time, ſo he gives us a ſecond way of inſtructing us; he accompanies, he ſeconds his Law with examples. In his Legal Books we have Rules; in the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical, Examples to practiſe by. And as he is every way abundant, as he hath added Law to Nature, and added Example to Law, ſo he hath added Example to Example; and by that Text which we have read to you here, and by that Text which we have left at home, our houſe and family, and by that Text which we have brought hither, our ſelves, and by that Text which we finde here, where we ſtand, and ſit, and kneel upon the bodies of ſome of our dead friends or neighbors, he gives to us, he repeats to us, a full, a various, a multiform, a manifold Catechiſm, and Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, to teach us that it is ſo abſolutely true, that <hi>there is not a
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:93368:152"/>
houſe in which there is not one dead,</hi> as that (taking ſpiritual death into our conſideration) there is not a houſe in which there is one alive.</p>
            <p>That therfore we may take in light at all theſe windows that God opens for us,<note place="margin">Diviſio.</note> that we may lay hold upon God by all theſe handles which he puts out to us, we ſhall make a brief ſurvey of theſe four Houſes; of that in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where the Text places it; of that at home, in which we dwell; of this, which is our ſelves, where we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways are, or always ſhould be within; and of this in which we are met, where God is in ſo many ſeveral Temples of his, as are above and under ground: So that this Sermon may be a general Funeral Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, both for <hi>them that are dead in the fleſh,</hi> and for our ſelves, that <hi>are dead in our ſins;</hi> for of all theſe four houſes it is true, and by uſeful accommodation, applyable to all, <hi>There is not a houſe where there is not one dead.</hi>

            <p>In the building of the material Temple, there was no hammer, nor tool of noiſe uſed: In the fitting and laying of us, the living ſtones of the myſtical Temple, God would uſe no hammer, no iron, no occaſion of noiſe, or lamentation; but there are diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions which will not be rectified without the hammer, and are not malleable neither, not fit to be rectified by the hammer, till a hot fire of vehement affliction have mollified them. <hi>Theſpeſius</hi> they ſay was a man deſperately vicious, irrecoverably wicked; his friends asked the Oracle whether ever he would mend? The Oracle anſwered, he would when he was dead; he died of a ſodain fall, at leaſt to the eyes, and in the underſtanding of the world he died; but he recovered, and came to life again, and then reported ſuch fearful viſions which he had ſeen in the other world, upon the ſouls of ſome of his companions, and of his own father, as that out of the apprehenſion of thoſe terrors in his extaſie, in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond life, he juſtified the Oracle; and after he had been dead, lived well. Many ſuch ſtories are in the Legends; but I take this at the fountain where they take moſt of theirs, that is, out of <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch;</hi> for <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> are two principal Evangeliſts of the Legendaries. The Moral of them all is, <hi>That God will imprint a knowledge of his Majeſty, and a terror of his Judgements, though the heart be Iron:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 12. Verſ. 33.</note> He would bring the Egyptians to ſay with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, <hi>We are dead men,</hi> though they would not be brought to ſay it, till <hi>there was not a houſe in which there was not one dead.</hi>

            <p>But as in a River that is ſwelled, though the water do bring down ſand and ſtones, and logs, yet the water is there ſtill; and the purpoſe of Nature is to vent that water, not to pour down that ſand, or thoſe ſtones: ſo though God be put to mingle his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:93368:153"/>
with his mercies, yet his mercy is there ſtill, and his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is, ever in thoſe judgments, to manifeſt his mercy. Where the Channel is ſtopped by thoſe Sands, and Stones, and Logs, the Water will finde another Channel; where the heart is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Gods corrections, and thereby made incapable of his mercy, (as in ſome diſpoſitions, even Gods corrections do work ſuch obſtructions and obdurations, as in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> caſe it was) yet the water will find a Channel, the mercy of God will flow out, and ſhew it ſelf to others, though not to him; his mercy will take effect ſomewhere, as (in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> caſe) it did upon the Children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And yet God would not ſhew mercy to them, but ſo, as that at the ſame time they alſo might ſee his judgments, and thereby be brought to ſay, God hath a Treaſury of both, <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Juſtice;</hi> and God might have changed the perſons, and made the <hi>Egyptians</hi> the objects of his <hi>Mercies,</hi> and us of his <hi>Juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt act of Gods mercy towards me, when I ſee him execute a judgment upon another, is to confeſs, that that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment belonged to me, and thereby to come to a <hi>holy fear,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the ſame condemnation; as the one Thief ſaid to the other, upon their ſeveral croſſes; <hi>Feareſt not thou, being under the ſame condemnation?</hi> At this time God delivered his Children out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> then was <hi>fulneſs of mercy:</hi> but God let them ſee his power and his powerful indignation upon others, for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.

The perſecuting Angel entred into none of their houſes, God let them live; but God, though he let them live, would not let them be ignorant, that he could have thrown death in at their windows too: <hi>For they came not into a houſe where there was not one dead.</hi>

Is not our firſt-born dead? Our firſt-born (ſays St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>) are the offspring of our beloved ſin; for we have ſome Concubine-ſins, and ſome one ſin that we are married to: Whatſoever we have begot upon that wife, whatſoever we have got by that ſin, that's our firſt-born, and that's dead: How much the better ſoever we make account to live by it, it is dead. For, as it was the miſchievous invention of a Perſecutor in the Primitive Church, to tie living men to dead bodies, and let them die ſo; ſo men that tie the reſt of their Eſtate to goods ill gotten, do but invent a way to ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all. But that which is truly every mans firſt-born-childe, is his zeal to the Religion and Service of God: As ſoon as we know
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:93368:155"/>
that there is a Soul, that Soul knows that there is a God, and a Worſhip belonging to that God; and this Worſhip is Religion. And is not this firſt-born childe dead in many of us? In him that is not ſtirr'd, not mov'd, not affected for his Religion, his pulſe is gone, and that's an ill ſign. In him that dares not ſpeak for it, not counſel, not preach for it, his Religion lies ſpeechleſs; and that's an ill ſign. In him that feeds not Religion, that gives nothing to the maintenance thereof, his Religion is in a conſumption. In a word, if his zeal be quenched, his firſt-born is dead.

                  <hi>Part</hi> 4.</note>The fourth Houſe falling under this ſurvey, is this Houſe in which we are met now, the houſe of God; the Church and the ground wrapped up in the ſame conſecration: and in this houſe you have ſeen, and ſeen in a lamentable abundance, and ſeen with ſad eyes, that for many moneths there hath ſcarce been one day in which there hath not been one dead. How ſhould there be but multiplicity of deaths? why ſhould it be, or be looked to be, or thought to be otherwiſe? The Maſter of the houſe, Chriſt Jeſus, is dead before; and now it is not ſo much a part of our puniſhment, for the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> as an imitation of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> to die; death is not ſo much a part of our debt to Nature, or Sin, or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, as a part of our conformity to him who died for us. If death were in the nature of it meerly evil to us, Chriſt would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us, even from this death, by his death. But as the death of Chriſt Jeſus is the Phyſick of mankinde, ſo this natural death of the body is the application of that Phyſick to every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar man, who only by death can be made capable of that glory which his death hath purchaſed for us. This Phyſick, all they whom God hath taken to him, have taken, and (by his grace) received life by it. Their firſt-born is dead; the body was made before the ſoul, and that body is dead. <hi>Rachel wept for her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and would not be comforted, becauſe they were not.</hi> If theſe children, and parents, and friends, and neighbours of ours were not, if they were reſolved into an abſolute annihilation, we could not be comforted in their behalf; but Chriſt, who ſays, he is <hi>the Life,</hi> leſt we ſhould think that to belong only to this life, ſays alſo that he is <hi>the Reſurrection.</hi> We were contracted to Chriſt in our Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, married to him in our Baptiſm, in the Grave we are bedded with him, and in the Reſurrection eſtated and put into poſſeſſion of his Kingdom: And therefore, becauſe theſe words do not only affect us with that ſad conſideration, That <hi>there is</hi> none of theſe houſes <hi>in whieh there is not one dead;</hi> but miniſter withall that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, That there is none ſo dad, but may have a Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, We ſhall paſs another ſhort ſurvey over all theſe Houſes.</p>

our ſelves, and the Church, as ſo many places of Infection, ſo many temporal or ſpiritual Peſthouſes, into which our ſins had heaped powder, and Gods indignation had caſt a match to kindle it. But now the very phraſe of the Text, which is, <hi>That in every houſe there was one dead, There was,</hi> invites us to a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar conſideration of Gods mercy, in that, howſoever it were, it is not ſo now; in which we ſhall look how far this beam of mercy ſhines out in every of theſe houſes, that it is not ſo now, There is not one dead in every houſe now; but the Infection, (Temporal and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Infection) is ſo far ceaſed, as that not only thoſe that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, do not die, as before; but thoſe whom we called dead, are not dead; they are alive in their ſpirits, <hi>in Abrahams boſome;</hi> and they are alive in their very bodies, in their contract and inherence in Chriſt Jeſus in an infallible aſſurance of a joyful Reſurrection.</p>

               <note place="margin">Egyptus.</note> herein we are interrupted. Here they were dead, and are dead ſtill: We ſee clearly enough Gods indignation upon them; but we ſee neither of thoſe beams of mercy, either that there die no more, or that we have the comfort of a joyful Reſurrection in them who are dead: For this fearful calamity of the death of their firſt-born wrought no more upon them, but to bring them to that exclamation, that vociferation, that voice of deſpairful murmuring, <hi>Omnes Morie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, We are all dead men:</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 33.</note> And they were miſchievous Prophets upon themſelves; for, proceeding in that ſin which induc'd that calamity and the reſt upon them, they purſued the children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> through the Red-ſea, and periſhed in it; and then they came not to die one in a houſe, but as it is expreſſed in the Story, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in the Pſalms,<note place="margin">Exod. 14.28.

               <hi>There remained not ſo much as one of them alive;</hi> ſo that in their caſe there is no comfort in the firſt beam of mercy, that this phraſe, <hi>They were dead,</hi> or <hi>They did die,</hi> ſhould intimate, That now they did not die, now Gods correction had ſo wrought upon them, as that God withdrew that correction from them, for it purſued them, and accompanied them to their final and total deſtruction. And then for the other beam of mercy, of transferring them which ſeemed dead in the eyes of the world, to a better life, by that hand of death, to preſent happineſs in their ſouls, and to an aſſured reſurrection to joy and glory in their bodies, in the communion of Gods Saints, <hi>Moſes</hi> hath given us little hope in their behalf; for thus he encourageth his Countreymen in that place, <hi>The Egyptians whom you have ſeen this day,</hi>

For theſe men that died in their ſins, that ſinned in their dying, that ſought and hunted after death ſo ſinfully, we have little comfort of ſuch men, in the phraſe of this Text, <hi>They were dead;</hi> for they are dead ſtill: As <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> I am afraid we may ſay of theſe men, We <hi>ſhall ſee them no more for ever.</hi>

reſurrection from all their ſinful habits, by the power of his grace, though reached to them with a bloody hand, and in a bitter cup, in this heavy calamity; and as Chriſt ſaid of himſelf, they ſhall ſay in him, <hi>I was dead, but am alive;</hi> and by that grace of God, I am that I am.</p>
            <p>The ſame comfort alſo ſhall we have in this phraſe of the Text, in our third Houſe; the third Houſe is not <hi>Domus noſtra,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Domus nos.</note> but <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus nos,</hi> not the Houſe we inhabit, but the Houſe we carry; not that Houſe which is our Houſe, but that Houſe which is our ſelves: There alſo, <hi>They were dead;</hi> they were, but are not. For beloved, we told you before in our former ſurvey of theſe ſeveral Houſes, That our firſt-born, (for ſtill ye remember, they were the firſt-born of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that induce all this application;) Our firſt-born in this Houſe, in our ſelves, is our Zeal; not meerly and generally our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but our zeal to our Religion. For Religion in general, is natural to us; the natural man hath naturally ſome ſenſe of God, and ſome inclination to worſhip that Power, whom he conceives to be God, and this Worſhip is Religion. But then the firſt thing that this general pious affection produces in us, is Zeal, which is an exaltation of Religion. <hi>Primus actus voluntatis eſt Amor;</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers and Divines agree in that, That the will of man cannot be idle, and the firſt act that the will of man produces, is Love; for till it love ſomething, prefer and chuſe ſomething, till it would have ſomething, it is not a Will; neither can it turn upon any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, before God. So that this firſt, and general, and natural love of God, is not begotten in my ſoul, nor produced by my ſoul, but created and infus'd with my ſoul, and as my ſoul; there is no ſoul that knows ſhe is a ſoul, without ſuch a general ſenſe of the love of God. But to love God above all, to love him with all my facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, this exaltation of this religious love of God, is the firſt-born of Religion, and this is Zeal. Religion, which is the Worſhip of that Power which I call God, does but make me a man; the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man hath that Religion; but that which makes me a Father, and gives me an off-ſpring, a firſt-born, that's Zeal: By Religion I am an <hi>Adam,</hi> but by Zeal I am an <hi>Abel</hi> produced out of that <hi>Adam.</hi> Now if we conſider times not long ſince paſt, there was ſcarce one houſe, ſcarce one of us, in whom this firſt-born, this Zeal was not dead. Diſcretion is the ballaſt of our Ship, that carries us ſteady; but Zeal is the very Fraight, the Cargaſon, the Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe it ſelf, which enriches us in the land of the living; and this was our caſe, we were all come to eſteem our Ballaſt more then our Fraight, our Diſcretion more then our Zeal; we had more care to pleaſe great men then God; more conſideration of an imaginary change of times, then of unchangeable eternity it ſelf. And as in ſtorms it falls out often that men caſt their Wares and their Fraights over-board, but never their Ballaſt, ſo as ſoon as we
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:93368:157"/>
thought we ſaw a ſtorm, in point of Religion, we caſt off our Zeal, our Fraight, and ſtuck to our Ballaſt, our Diſcretion, and thought it ſufficient to ſail on ſmoothly, and ſteadily, and calmly, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcreetly in the world, and with the time, though not ſo directly to the right Haven. So our firſt-born in this Houſe, in our ſelves, our Zeal, was dead. <hi>It was;</hi> there's the comfortable word of our Text. But now, now that God hath taken his fan into his hand, and ſifted his Church, now that God hath put us into a ſtraight and crooked Limbeck, paſſed us through narrow and difficult tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and ſet us upon a hot fire, and drawn us to a more precious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and nature then before; now that God hath given our Zeal a new concoction, a new refining, a new inanimation by this fire of tribulation, let us embrace and nurſe up this new reſurrection of this Zeal, which his own Spirit hath begot and produced in us, and return to God with a whole and entire ſoul, without dividing or ſcattering our affections upon other objects; and in the ſincerity of the true Religion, without inclinations in our ſelves, to induce; and without inclinableneſs, from others, upon whom we may depend, to admit, any dramms of the dregs of a ſuperſtitious Religion; for it is a miſerable extremity, when we muſt take a little poyſon for phyſick. And ſo having made the right uſe of Gods corrections, we ſhall enjoy the comfort of this phraſe, in this Houſe, our ſelves, our firſt-born, our Zeal was dead; it was, but it is not.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, in this fourth Houſe, the Houſe where we ſtand now, the Houſe of God, and of his Saints, God affords us a fair beam of this conſolation, in the phraſe of this Text alſo, <hi>They were dead.</hi> How appliable to you, in this place, is that which God ſaid to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Put off thy ſhoes, for thou treadeſt on holy ground;</hi> put off all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, all ſtanding, all relying upon worldly aſſurances, and conſider upon what ground you tread; upon ground ſo holy, as that all the ground is made of the bodies of Chriſtians, and therein hath received a ſecond conſecration. Every puff of wind within theſe walls, may blow the father into the ſons eys, or the wife into her husbands, or his into hers, or both into their childrens, or their childrens into both. Every grain of duſt that flies here, is a piece of a Chriſtian; you need not diſtinguiſh your Pews by figures; you need not ſay, I ſit within ſo many of ſuch a neighbour, but I ſit within ſo many inches of my husbands, or wives, or childes, or friends grave. Ambitious men never made more ſhift for places in Court, then dead men for graves in Churches; and as in our later times, we have ſeen two and two almoſt in every Place and Office, ſo almoſt every Grave is oppreſſed with twins; and as at Chriſts reſurrection ſome of the dead aroſe out of their graves, that were buried again; ſo in this lamentable calamity, the dead were buried, and thrown up again before they were reſolved to duſt, to make room for more. But are all theſe dead? <hi>They were,</hi> ſays
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:93368:157"/>
the Text; they were in your eys, and therefore we forbid not that office of the eye, that holy tenderneſs, to weep for them that are ſo dead. But there was a part in every one of them, that could not die; which the God of life, who breathed it into them, from his own mouth, hath ſuck'd into his own boſome. And in that part which could die, <hi>They were dead,</hi> but they are not. The ſoul of man is not ſafer wrapt up in the boſome of God, then the body of man is wrapt up in the Contract, and in the eternal Decree of the Reſurrection. As ſoon ſhall God tear a leaf out of the Book of Life, and caſt ſo many of the Elect into Hell fire, as leave the body of any of his Saints in corruption for ever. To what body ſhall Chriſt Jeſus be loth to put to his hand, to raiſe it from the grave, then, that put to his very God-head, the Divinity it ſelf, to aſſume all our bodies, when in one perſon, he put on all mankinde in his Incarnation? As when my true repentance hath re-ingraffed me in my God, and re-incorporated me in my Savior, no man may reproach me, and ſay, Thou waſt a ſinner: So, ſince all theſe dead bodies ſhall be reſtored by the power, and are kept alive in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of Almighty God, we cannot ſay, <hi>They are,</hi> ſcarce that they were dead. When time ſhall be no more, when death ſhall be no more, they ſhall renew, or rather continue their being. But yet, beloved, for this ſtate of their grave, (for it becomes us to call it a ſtate; it is not an annihilation, no part of Gods Saints can come to nothing) as this ſtate of theirs is not to be lamented, as though they had loſt any thing which might have conduced to their good, by departing out of this world; ſo neither is it a ſtate to be joyed in ſo, as that we ſhould expoſe our ſelves to dangers unneceſſarily, in thinking that we want any thing conducing to our good, which the dead enjoy. As between two men of equal age, if one ſleep, and the other wake all night, yet they riſe both of an equal age in the morning; ſo they who ſhall have ſlept out a long night of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ages in the grave, and they who ſhall be caught up in the clouds, to meet the Lord Jeſus in the aire, at the laſt day, ſhall enter all at once in their bodies into Heaven. No antiquity, no ſeniority for their bodies; neither can their ſouls who went before, be ſaid to have been there a minute before ours, becauſe we ſhall all be in a place that reckons not by minutes. Clocks and Sun-dials were but a late invention upon earth; but the Sun it ſelf, and the earth it ſelf, was but a late invention in heaven. God had been an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, a ſuper-infinite, an unimaginable ſpace, millions of millions of unimaginable ſpaces in heaven, before the Creation. And our afternoon ſhall be as long as Gods forenoon; for, as God never ſaw beginning, ſo we ſhall never ſee end; but they whom we tread up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on now, and we whom others ſhall tread upon hereafter, ſhall meet at once, where, though we were dead, dead in our ſeveral houſes, dead in a ſinful <hi>Egypt,</hi> dead in our family, dead in our ſelves, dead
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:93368:158"/>
in the Grave, yet we ſhall be received, with that conſolation, and glorious conſolation, you were dead, but are alive. <hi>Enter ye bleſſed into the Kingdom, prepared for you, from the beginning.</hi>

            <p>NExt to the eternal and coeſſential Word of God, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the written Word of God, the Scriptures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us moſt; and therefore next to the perſon of Chriſt, and his Offices, the Devil hath troubled the Church, with moſt queſtions about the certainty of Scriptures, and the Canon thereof. It was late, before the Spirit of God ſetled and eſtabliſhed an unanime, and general conſent in his Church, for the accepting of this Book of <hi>Eſther:</hi> For, not onely the holy Biſhop <hi>Melito</hi> (who defended the Chriſtians by an Apology to the Emperor) removed this Book from the Canon of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, One hundred and fifty years after Chriſt; but <hi>Athanaſius</hi> alſo, Three hundred and forty years after Chriſt, refuſed it too: Yea, <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> (though he deſerved, and had the ſtile and title of <hi>Theologus, The Divine;</hi> and though he came to clearer times, living almoſt Four hundred years after Chriſt) did not yet ſubmit himſelf to an acceptation of this Book. But a long time there hath been no doubt of it; and it is certainly part of that Scripture which is profitable to teach,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.16.</note> to reprove, to correct, and to inſtruct in righteouſneſs. To which purpoſe, we ſhall ſee what is afforded us in this Hiſtory of this Heroical Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>Eſther;</hi> what ſhe did in a perplexed and ſcrupulous caſe, when an evident danger appeared, and an evident Law was againſt

her action; and from thence conſider,<note place="margin">Serm. 22.</note> what every Chriſtian Soul ought to do, when it is ſurpriſed and overtaken with any ſuch ſcruples or difficulties to the Conſcience.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Eſther</hi> in particular, this was her caſe. She being Wife to the King, <hi>Haman,</hi> who had great power with the King, had got from him an Edict, for the deſtruction of all her people the <hi>Jews.</hi> When this was intimated to her by <hi>Mordecai,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to her Conſcience, not onely an irreligious forſaking of God, if ſhe forbore to mediate and uſe her intereſt in the King for the ſaving of hers, and Gods people; but an unnatural and unprovident forſaking of her ſelf, becauſe her danger was involved in theirs; and that ſhe her ſelf being of that Nation, could not be ſafe in her perſon, though in the Kings houſe, if that Edict were executed, though ſhe had not then ſo ordinary acceſs to the King, as formerly ſhe had had: yea, though there were a Law in her way, that ſhe might not come till ſhe was called, yet ſhe takes the reſolution to go, ſhe puts off all Paſſion, and all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular reſpects, ſhe conſecrates the whole action to God; and having in a rectified and well informed Conſcience found it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him, ſhe neglects both that particular Law, That none might have acceſs to the King uncalled, and that general Law, That every Man is bound to preſerve himſelf; and ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes her ſelf to an imminent, and (for any thing ſhe knew) an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcapable danger of death: <hi>If I periſh, I periſh.</hi>

            <p>For the eaſe of all our memories, we ſhall provide beſt,<note place="margin">Diviſio.</note> by contracting all, which we are to handle, to theſe two parts; <hi>Eſthers</hi> preparation, and <hi>Eſthers</hi> reſolution: How ſhe diſpoſed her ſelf, how ſhe reſolved: What her conſultation was, what her executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was to be. Her preparation is an humiliation; and there, firſt ſhe prepares, that that glory which God ſhould receive, by that humiliation, ſhould be general; All the people ſhould be taught, and provoked to glorifie God; <hi>vade, congrega, Go, and aſſemble all.</hi> Secondly, The act which they were to do, was to faſt, <hi>Jeju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate:</hi> And thirdly, It was a limited faſt, <hi>Tribus diebus, Eat not, nor drink in three days, and three nights:</hi> And then, this faſt of theirs, was with relation, and reſpect to her, <hi>Jejunate ſuper me, Faſt ye for me.</hi> But yet ſo, as ſhe would not receive an eaſe by their affliction; put them to do it for her, and ſhe do nothing for her ſelf; <hi>Ego cum Ancillis, I and my Maids will faſt too;</hi> and <hi>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militer, likewiſe,</hi> that is, As exactly as they ſhall. And ſo far extends her preparation: Her reſolution derives it ſelf into two branches. Firſt, That ſhe will break an Humane and Poſitive Law, <hi>Ingrediar contra legem, I will go in, though it be not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law;</hi> and ſecondly, She neglects even the Law of Nature, the Law of Self-preſervation, <hi>Si peream, peream.</hi>

How good ſoever their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence (and perchance purpoſe) be, that aſſemble people, and diſcontent them, the bridle, the ſtern, is no longer in their hands; but there ariſe unexpected ſtorms, of which, if they were not authors in their purpoſe, yet they are the occaſioners.

In the Old Teſtament God gave expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, <hi>De Jejuniis ſtativis;</hi> certain fix'd and Anniverſary Faſts: <hi>The tenth of the ſame moneth ſhall be a holy Convocation unto you,</hi> &amp; affligetis animas veſtras, <hi>Ye ſhall humble your ſouls;</hi> and every perſon that doth not that, that ſame day,<note place="margin">Levit. 23.27.</note> 
               <hi>ſhall even be cut off from his people.</hi> The diſeaſe which they had is hereditary to us; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcencies in the fleſh, and coldneſs in the ſervice of God: And though it may be true, that the Church cannot know my particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar infirmities, nor the time when they preſs me; yet as no Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an for the body can preſcribe me a Receipt againſt a Fever, and bid me take it ſuch a day, becauſe perchance at that day I ſhall have no Fever; yet he can preſcribe me certain Rules and Receipts, which if I take at his times, I ſhall be the ſafer all the year: So our Spiritual Phyſician, the Church, though ſhe cannot know when my body needs this particular Phyſick of faſting, yet ſhe knows, that by obſerving the time which ſhe preſcribes, I ſhall always be in the better ſpiritual health. As ſoon as the Church was ſetled, Faſts were ſetled too: When in the Primitive Church they fix'd certain times for giving Orders, and making Miniſters, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Faſts at thoſe times; when they fix'd certain times for ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Baptiſm, (as they did <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Whitſontide</hi>) they appointed Faſts then too; and ſo they did in their ſolemn and publick Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. So alſo when Chriſtians encreaſed in number, and that therefore, beſides the Sabbath-day, they us'd to call them to Church, and to give the Sacrament upon other days too; as ſoon as Wedneſday and Friday were appointed for that purpoſe, for the Sacrament, they were appointed to be faſted too. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when St. <hi>Cyril</hi> ſays,<note place="margin">Cyril.</note> 
               <hi>Vis tibi oſtendam, quale jejunare debes je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junium? Jejuna ab omni peccato.</hi> Shall I tell you what Faſt God looks for at your hands, <hi>Faſt from ſin;</hi> yet this is not all the Faſting that he exacts, (though it be indeed the effect and accompliſhment of all) but he adds, <hi>Non ideo hoc dicimus,</hi> We ſay not this, ſays he, becauſe we would give liberty, <hi>Habemus enim quadrageſimum, &amp; quartum, &amp; ſextum Hebdomadae diem quibus ſolemniter jejunamus,</hi> We have a fixed Lent to faſt in, and we have Wedneſdays and Fridays fixt to faſt in. In all times, Gods people had fixed and limited Faſts, beſides theſe Faſts which were enjoyned upon emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent dangers, as this of <hi>Eſter.</hi> In which there is a harder circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance then this, That it was a Faſt limited to certain days; for it is,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:93368:162"/>
               <hi>Jejunate pro me,</hi> Faſt you for me. And theſe words may ſeem to give ſome colour, ſome countenance to the Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, That the merits of one man may be applyed to another; which Doctrine is the foundation of Indulgences, and the fuel of Purgatory: In which they go ſo far, as to ſay, That one may fee an Attorney to ſatisfie God for him; he may procure another man to Faſt,<note place="margin">Grether.</note> or do other works of mortification for him: And he that does ſo for his Client, <hi>Sanguinem pro ſanguine Chriſto reddit,</hi> He pays Chriſt his blood again, and gives him as much as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from him; and more, <hi>Deum ſibi debitorem efficit,</hi> he brings God into his debt, and may turn that dept upon whom he will; and God muſt wipe off ſo much of the other mans ſcore, to whom he intends it. They go beyond this too; That ſatisfaction may be made to God, even by our ſelves after our death: As they ſay, when they had brought <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperor to that mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that he commanded upon his death-bed, that his body ſhould be whipped after he was dead; that purpoſe of his, though it were not executed, was a ſatisfaction of the Juſtice of God. And (as error can finde no place to ſtop at) they go yet farther, when they extend this power of ſatisfaction even to Hell it ſelf, by authorizing thoſe fables, That a dead man which appeared, and ſaid he was damned, was by this flagellation, by his friends whipping of himſelf in his behalf, brought to repentance in hell, and ſo to faith in hell, and ſo to ſalvation in hell.</p>
            <p>But in the words of <hi>Eſther</hi> here is no intimation of this Hereſie; when Queen <hi>Eſther</hi> appoints others to faſt for her, ſhe knew ſhe could no more be the better for their faſting, then ſhe could be the leaner, or in the better health for it; but becauſe ſhe was to have benefit by the ſubſequent act, by their prayers, ſhe provokes them to that, by which their prayers might be the more acceptable and effectual, that is, to faſting. And ſo becauſe the whole action was for her, and her good ſucceſs in that enterprize, they are in that ſenſe properly ſaid to have faſted for her: So that this <hi>Jejunate ſuper me,</hi> as the word is, <hi>Gnalai, ſuper me,</hi> in my behalf, is no more but <hi>Orate pro me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hier.</note> Pray for me; and ſo Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> tranſlates theſe words, <hi>Orate pro me,</hi> Pray for me. And therefore, ſince Prayers is the way which God hath given us to batter Heaven, whether <hi>facta manu Deum oramus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tertul.</note> 
               <hi>&amp; vim gratum ei facimus,</hi> whether we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege God with our prayers, in theſe publick Congregations, or whether we wraſtle with him hand to hand in our Chambers, in the battel of a troubled Conſcience, let us live ſoberly and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately; and in <hi>Bello,</hi> and in <hi>Duello,</hi> here in the Congregation, and at home in our private Colluctations, we ſhall be the likelier to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with God; for though we receive aſſiſtance from the prayer of others, that muſt not make us lazie in our own behalfs; which is <hi>Eſthers</hi> laſt preparation, ſhe bids all the people faſt for her, that
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:93368:162"/>
is, for the good ſucceſs of her good purpoſes; but not the people alone, ſhe and her own maids will faſt likewiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qui fecit te ſine te, non ſalvabit te ſine te,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ego &amp; Ancill.</note> is a ſaying of Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> never too often repeated; and God and his Church are of one minde; for the Church that did Baptize thee without thy asking, will not faſt for thee, nor pray for thee, without thou faſt and pray for thy ſelf. As in ſpiritual things, charity begins with ourſelves, and I am bound to wiſh my own ſalvation, rather then any other mans; ſo I am bound to truſt to my making ſure of my ſalvation, by that which I do my ſelf, rather then by that which I procure others to do for me. <hi>Domus Dei, Domus orationis;</hi> we have ineſtimable profit by the publick Prayers of the Church, the Houſe of God; but as there is <hi>Deus, &amp; Domus ejus,</hi> ſo there muſt be <hi>Ego, &amp; Domus mea, I and my Houſe will ſerve the Lord.</hi>

It was a great confidence in that Prieſt that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted Saint <hi>Auguſtines</hi> Mother, <hi>Fieri non poteſt, ut filius iſtarum lachrymarum pereat,</hi> It is impoſſible that the ſon, for whom ſo good a mother hath poured out ſo devout tears, ſhould periſh at laſt; it was a confidence which no man may take to himſelf, to go to Heaven by that water, the tears of other men; but <hi>tu &amp; domus tua, Do thou and thy houſe ſerve the Lord;</hi> teach thine own eyes to weep, thine own body to fulfil the ſufferings of Chriſt; thine own appetite to faſt, thine own heart, and thine own tongue to pray. Come and participate of the devotions of the Church; but yet alſo in thy Chappel of eaſe, in thine own Bed-chamber, provide that thy ſelf and thy ſervants, all thy ſenſes, and all thy faculties, may alſo faſt and pray; and ſo go with a religious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence as <hi>Eſther</hi> did, about all thy other worldly buſineſſes and undertakings.</p>
            <p>This was her Preparation. Her Devotion hath two branches;<note place="margin">2. <hi>Part.</hi>
               </note> ſhe was to tranſgreſs a poſitive Law, a Law of the State; and ſhe neglected the Law of Nature it ſelf, in expoſing her ſelf to that danger. How far Humane Laws do binde the conſcience, how far they lay ſuch an obligation upon us, as that, if we tranſgreſs them, we do not only incur the penalty, but ſin towards God, hath been a perplexed queſtion in all times, and in all places. But how divers ſoever their opinions be, in that, they all agree in this, That no Law, which hath all the eſſential parts of a Law, (for Laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, Laws beyond the power of him that pretends to make them, are no Laws) no Law can be ſo meerly a Humane Law, but that there is in it a Divine part. There is in every Humane Law, part of the Law of God, which is obedience to the Superior. That Man cannot binde the conſcience, becauſe he cannot judge the
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:93368:163"/>
conſcience, nor he cannot abſolve the conſcience, may be a good argument; but in Laws made by that power which is ordained by God, man bindes not, but God himſelf: And then you muſt be ſubject, not becauſe of wrath, but becauſe of conſcience. Though then the matter and ſubject of the Law, that which the Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, or prohibits, may be an indifferent action, yet in all theſe, God hath his part; and there is a certain Divine ſoul, and ſpark of Gods power, which goes through all Laws, and inanimates them. In all the Canons of the Church, God hath his voice, <hi>Ut omnia ordine fiant;</hi> that all things be done decently, and in order; ſo the Canon that ordains that, is from God; in all the other Laws he hath his voice too, <hi>Ut piè &amp; tranquillè vivatur,</hi> That we may live peaceably, and religiouſly, and ſo thoſe Laws are from God: And in all, of all ſorts, this voice of his ſounds evidently, <hi>qui reſiſtit ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nationi,</hi> he that reſiſts his Commiſſion, his Lieutenancy, his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, in Law-makers appointed by him, reſiſts himſelf. There is no Law that is meerly humane, but only <hi>Lex in membris, The Law in our fleſh, which rebels againſt the Law in our minde;</hi> and this is a Rebellion, a Tyranny, no lawful Government. In all true Laws God hath his intereſt; and the obſerving of them in that reſpect, as made by his authority, is an act of worſhip and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to him; and the tranſgreſſing of them, with that relation, that is, a reſiſting or undervaluing of that authority, is certainly ſinne. How then was <hi>Eſthers</hi> act exempt from this? for ſhe went directly againſt a direct Law, <hi>That none ſhould come to the King uncalled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whenſoever divers Laws concur and meet together, that Law which comes from the ſuperior Magiſtrate, and is in the nature of the thing commanded, higheſt too, that Law muſt prevail. If two Laws lie upon me, and it be impoſſible to obey both, I muſt obey that which comes immediately from the greateſt power, and impoſes the greateſt duty. Here met in her, the fix'd and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Law, of promoting Gods glory, and a new Law of the King, to augment his greatneſs and Majeſty, by this retiredneſs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying of ordinary acceſs to his perſon. Gods Law, for his glory, which is infinite and unſearchable, and the Kings Law, for his eaſe, (of which ſhe knows the reaſon, and the ſcope) were in the ballance together; if this Law of the King had been of any thing naturally and eſſentially evil in it ſelf, no circumſtance could have delivered her from ſin, if ſhe had done againſt it. Though the Law were but concerning an indifferent action, and of no great importance, yet becauſe Gods Authority is in every juſt Law, if ſhe could not have been ſatisfied in her conſcience, that that Law might admit an exception, and a diſpenſation in her caſe, ſhe had ſinn'd in breaking it. But when ſhe proceeded not upon any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation, upon any ſingular or ſeditious ſpirit, when ſhe debated
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:93368:163"/>
the matter temperately with a diſpaſſioned man, <hi>Mordecai;</hi> when ſhe found a reſervation even in the body of the Law, That if the King held up his Scepter, the Law became no Law to that party, when ſhe might juſtly think her ſelf out of the Law, which was (as <hi>Joſephus</hi> delivers it) <hi>Ut nemo ex domeſticis acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deret,</hi> That none of his ſervants ſhould come into his preſence uncalled; ſhe was then come to that, which onely can excuſe and juſtifie the breaking of any Law, that is, a probable, if not a certain aſſurance, contracted <hi>Bona fide,</hi> in a rectified conſcience, That if this preſent caſe, which makes us break this Law, had been known and conſidered when the Law was made, he that made the Law would have made proviſion for this caſe. No preſuming of a pardon, when the Law is broken; no diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given before hand to break it, can ſettle the Conſcience; nor any other way, then a Declaration well grounded, that that particular caſe was never intended to have been compoſed in that Law, nor the reaſon and purpoſe thereof.</p>
            <p>So, when the Conſcience of <hi>Eſther</hi> was, and ſo when the Conſcience of any particular Chriſtian, is, after due conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the matter, come to a religious and temperate aſſurance, That he may break any Law; his aſſurance muſt be grounded upon this, That if that Law were now to be made, that caſe which he hath preſently in hand, would not be included by him that made that Law, in that Law; otherwiſe to violate a Law, either becauſe, being but a Humane Law, I think I am diſcharged, paying the penalty; or, becauſe I have good means to the King, I may preſume of a pardon in all caſes, where my priviledge works any other way, then, as we have ſaid, (that is, that our caſe is not intended in that Law) it had been in <hi>Eſther,</hi> it ſhould be in us a ſin to tranſgreſs any Law, though of a Law-nature, and of an indifferent action. But upon thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which we mentioned before, <hi>Eſther</hi> might ſee, that that Law admitted ſome exceptions, and that no exception was likelier then this, That the King for all his majeſtical reſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, would be content to receive information of ſuch a diſhonor done to his Queen, and to her god; ſhe might juſtly think that that Law, intended onely for the Kings eaſe, or his ſtate, reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to her perſon, who was his wife, nor to her caſe, which was the deſtruction of all that profeſſed her Religion.</p>
            <p>It was then no ſin in her to go in to the King,<note place="margin">Si Peream.</note> though not according to the Law; but ſhe may ſeem to have ſinned, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing her ſelf to ſo certain a danger as that Law inflicted; with ſuch a reſolution, <hi>Si peream, peream, If I periſh, I periſh.</hi> How far a man may lawfully, and with a good conſcience, forſake himſelf, and expoſe himſelf to danger, is a point of too much largeneſs, and intricacy, and perplexity to handle now: The
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:93368:164"/>
general ſtream of Caſuiſts runs thus, That a private man may lawfully expoſe himſelf to certain danger, for the preſerving of the Magiſtrate, or of a ſuperior perſon; and that reaſon might have juſtified <hi>Eſthers</hi> enterpriſe, if her ruine might have ſaved her Country; but in her caſe, if ſhe had periſhed, they were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to periſh too. But ſhe is ſafer then in that; for firſt, ſhe had hope out of the words of the Law, out of the dignity of her place, out of the Juſtice of the King, out of the preparation which ſhe had made by Prayer; which Prayer, <hi>Joſephus</hi> (either out of tradition, or out of conjecture and likelihood) Records to have been, That God would make both her Language and her Beauty acceptable to the King that day: Out of all theſe, ſhe had hope of good ſucceſs; and howſoever if ſhe failed of her pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſhe was under two Laws, of which it was neceſſary to obey that which concerned the glory of God. And therefore <hi>Daniels</hi> confidence, and <hi>Daniels</hi> words became her well, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, our God is able to deliver me, and he will deliver me; but if he will not, I muſt not forſake his honor, nor abandon his ſervice: And therefore,</hi> Si peream, peream, <hi>If I periſh, I periſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not always a Chriſtian reſolution, <hi>Si peream, peream,</hi> to ſay, <hi>If I periſh, I periſh:</hi> I care not whether I periſh, or no: To admit, to invite, to tempt tentations, and occaſions of ſin, and ſo to put our ſelves to the hazard of a ſpiritual periſhing; to give fire to concupiſcencies with licentious Meditations, either of ſinful pleaſures paſt, or of that which we have then in our purpoſe and purſuit; to fewel this fire with meats of curioſity and provocation; to blow this fire with laſcivious diſcourſes and Letters, and Proteſtations, this admits no ſuch condition, <hi>Si pereas,</hi> If thou periſh; but <hi>periiſti,</hi> thou art periſhed already; thou didſt then periſh, when thou didſt ſo deſperately caſt thy ſelf into the danger of periſhing. And as he that caſts himſelf from a ſteeple, doth not break his neck till he touch the ground; but yet he is truly ſaid to have killed himſelf, when he threw himſelf towards the ground: So in thoſe preparations, and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to ſin, we periſh, before we periſh, before we commit the act, the ſin it ſelf: We periſhed then, when we opened our ſelves to the danger of the ſin; ſo alſo, if a man will wring out, not the Club out of <hi>Hercules</hi> hands, but the ſword out of Gods hands; if a man will uſurpe upon Gods juriſdiction, and become a Magiſtrate to himſelf, and revenge his own quarrels, and in an inordinate defence of imaginary honor, expoſe himſelf to danger in duel, with a <hi>ſi peream, peream, If I periſh, I periſh,</hi> that is not onely true, if he periſh, he periſhes; if he periſh temporally, he periſhes ſpiritually too, and goes out of the world loaded with that, and with all his other ſins; but it is alſo true, that if he periſh not, he periſhes; he comes back loaded both with the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:93368:164"/>
temporal, and with the ſpiritual death, both with the blood, and with the damnation of that man, who periſhed ſuddenly, and without repentance by his ſword.</p>
            <p>To contract this, and conclude all, If a man have nothing in his contemplation, but dignity, and high place; if he have not Vertue, and Religion, and a Conſcience of having deſerved well of his Countrey, and the love of God and godly men, for his ſuſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and aſſurance, but onely to tower up after dignity, as a Hawk after a prey, and think that he may boldly ſay, as an impoſſible ſuppoſition, <hi>Si peream, peream, If I periſh, I periſh;</hi> as though it were impoſſible he ſhould periſh; he ſhall be ſubject to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion of the King of <hi>Babylon, Quomodo Cecidiſti,</hi>

            <p>But that provident and religious Soul, which proceeds in all her enterpriſes as <hi>Eſther</hi> did in her preparations, which firſt calls an aſſembly of all her Country-men, that is, them of the houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of the Faithful, the Congregation of Chriſts Church, and the Communion of Saints, and comes to participate the benefit of publick Prayers in his houſe, inconvenient times; and then doth the ſame in her own houſe, within doors, ſhe, and her maids, that is, ſhe and all her ſenſes and faculties, This ſoul may alſo come to <hi>Eſthers</hi> reſolution, to go in to the King, though it be not according to the Law; though that Law be, That neither fornicator, nor adulterer, nor wanton, nor thief, nor drunkard, nor covetous, nor extortioner, nor railer, ſhall have acceſs into the Kingdom of Heaven; yet this ſoul thus prepared ſhall feel a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable aſſurance, that this Law was made for ſervants, and not for ſons, nor for the Spouſe of Chriſt, his Church, and the living Members thereof; and ſhe may boldly ſay, <hi>Si peream, peream;</hi> It is all one though I periſh; or as it is in the Original, <hi>Vecaſher, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modocunque peream;</hi> whether I periſh in my eſtimation and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with men, whether I periſh in my fortunes, honor, or health, <hi>quomodocunque,</hi> it is all one; <hi>Heaven and earth ſhall paſs away, but Gods word ſhall not paſs;</hi> and we have both that word of God which ſhall never have end, and that word of God which never had beginning.

                  <p>Take heed to thy ſelf, that thou be not ſnared by following them after they be deſtroyed from before thee; and that thou inquire not after their gods, ſaying, How did thoſe nations ſerve their gods? even ſo will I do likewiſe.</p>

            <p>WHen I conſider our aſcenſion in this life, (that which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Who ſhall aſcend into the hill of the Lord?</hi>) I ſee the Prophet adds there,<note place="margin">Pſal. 24.30.</note> as another manner of expreſſing the ſame thing, <hi>And who ſhall ſtand in that holy place? Quis aſcendet, &amp; quis ſtabit?</hi> A man does not aſcend, except he ſtand. And ſuch an aſcenſion (an aſcenſion without a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcent) <hi>Moſes</hi> provides for here. Firſt they ſhould aſcend to an aboliſhing of all Idolatry; And then they ſhould ſtand in that ſtate, perſevere in that ſtation, and perpetuate that aſcenſion to themſelves, by ſhutting themſelves up againſt any new reentries of that Idolatry which had been once happily baniſhed from amongſt them. The inchoation of this aſcenſion, that ſtep which is happily made in the aboliſhing of idolatry, is in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Chapter; <hi>Ye ſhall utterly deſtroy all the places,</hi> (which is a vehement gradation and heightening of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment:) It is a deſtruction, not a faint diſcontinuing of idolatry, but deſtruction; It is utter deſtruction, not a defacing, not a deferring of idolatry; and it is the utter deſtruction of the very place, not a ſeiſing the riches of the place, nor a ſlight correction of the abuſes of the place, but the place it ſelf, and (as is there expreſſed) all the place, not to leave the Devil one Chappel wherein the Nations had ſerved their gods. And the Holy Ghoſt proceeds in the next verſe with this particular ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency, <hi>You ſhall overthrow their altars, break their pillars, burn their groves, hew down their images, and deſtroy their names.</hi> But all this is but the inchoation of this aſcenſion, the firſt ſtep in aboliſhing idolatry: The conſummation of it is, in ſtanding there; and that's in this Text, <hi>Take heed to thy ſelf, &amp;c.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Serm. 23.</note>The words are an Inhibition, and the perſons are all they to whom God hath extended his favors, ſo far as to deliver them from Idolatry formerly practiſed amongſt them,<note place="margin">Diviſio.</note> and to bring them to the ſincere worſhip of his Name. And for ſuch perſons we need not go far, for we our ſelves are they. God hath given us ſuch a deliverance heretofore in the reformation of Religion; ſo far we are aſcended, and ſo the Inhibition lies upon us, that we ſlide not back again. It hath two parts; 1. The main matter of the Inhibition, That we be not ſnared by Idolaters, after they have been deſtroyed from before us. And ſecondly, two particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar dangers whereby we may be ſnared; Firſt, by following them: Take heed you be not ſnared by them; and then by an over-cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious enquiring into their Religion, <hi>Enquire not after their Gods,</hi> &amp;c. And through the firſt, the matter of the Inhibition, we ſhall paſs by theſe ſteps, 1. That there is no ſecurity; there is ſtill danger, though the Idolater be deſtroyed. And ſecondly, That there is therefore a diligence to be required, <hi>Take heed to thy ſelf.</hi> And then thirdly, That the danger from which this diligence muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us, is a <hi>ſnare; Take heed leſt thou be ſnared.</hi> And for the branches of the ſecond part, the <hi>ſnare of following them;</hi> the ſnare of enquiring into their opinions; it ſhall leaſt incumber you to have them opened then, when we come to handle them; firſt we paſs through the firſt part.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Part.</hi>
               </note>In that, the firſt branch is, That there is no ſecurity, though the enemy be deſtroyed. And there we are to conſider firſt, what amounts to a deſtruction, what is called a deſtruction in this caſe; God had promiſed the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that he would give all the inhabitants of the Land of Promiſe into their hands; that he would aboliſh them, deſtroy them, and (as his own phraſe is) <hi>cut them off.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 23.23.</note> God performs all his promiſes; was this performed to them? did God deſtroy them all? Truly it was very much that God did in this behalf. He got great victories for them, and by ſtrange means. One angel was able to deſtroy for them almoſt 200 thouſand <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> in one night in <hi>Senacheribs</hi> Army.<note place="margin">2 Kin. 19.35.</note> This was a real execution by the hands of one, who having Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, had truly Power to do it, an Angel. But he prevailed for them ſo too in another caſe, only by an apparition of Angels, when there was no blow ſtrucken,<note place="margin">2 Kin. 6.16.</note> when <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s ſervant ſaw mountains full of Horſes and Chariots of fire. He prevailed for them by creatures of a much lower rank, and weak in their nature,<note place="margin">Exod. 23.28.</note> by Hornets. He promiſes <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he would ſend Hornets before them, and they ſhould drive out the Inhabitants of the Land. He prevails for them by creatures of a lower rank then they,<note place="margin">Joſ. 10.10.</note> by creatures without life, by ſtones. The Lord diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited them by great ſtones from heaven. He prevailed by that which is no creature, no ſubſiſtence, a ſound only, The Lord thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:93368:166"/>
with a great Thunder upon the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and diſcomfeited them. He took a lower way then this, he employed nothing, and yet did the work, by imprinting a terror in their hearts,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 7.10.</note> 
               <hi>Five of you ſhall chaſe a hundred, and a hundred of you ſhall put ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand to flight.</hi> And a way lower then that;<note place="margin">2 Kin. 6.17.</note> he wrought not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their mindes, but upon their ſenſes. He ſmote a whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with blindneſs. And he went further yet; he did nothing at all upon them, and yet wrought his purpoſe, only by diverſion; when <hi>Saul</hi> purſued <hi>David</hi> with the moſt vehemence of all,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 23.27.</note> a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger came and told him that the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> had invaded his Land, and then he gave over the purſuit of <hi>David.</hi> Really great, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably ſtrange things did God in the behalf of his children, for the deſtruction of his and their Idolatrous enemies. But yet were they ever deſtroy'd? totally deſtroy'd they were not; The Lord left ſome Nations (ſays the Text there) without haſtily driving them out; neither did he deliver them into the hands of <hi>Joſhuah.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Judg. 2.23.</note> 
               <hi>The Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſites dwell with the children of</hi> Benjamin <hi>in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>unto this day,</hi> (ſays that holy ſtory) and ſo did other Nations with the other Tribes in other places.<note place="margin">1.21.28.</note> They were able (as we are told there) to put the <hi>Canaanites</hi> to Tribute, but not to drive them out; to make Penal Laws againſt them, but not to deliver the Land of them. Now why did God do this? We would not ask this queſtion, if God had not told us, <hi>ut erudiret in iis Jeruſalem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3.2.</note> that the Enemy might be their Schoolmaſter, and War their Chatechiſm, that they might never think that they ſtood in no more need of God. <hi>The Lord was with Judah,</hi> (ſaith the Text) ſo far with him,<note place="margin">1.19.</note> as that he drave out the Inhabitants of the Mountain, but yet would not drive out the Inhabitants of the Valley. Sometimes God does the greater work, and yet leaves ſome leſſer things undone. God chooſes his Matter and his Manner, and his Meaſure, and his Means, and his Minutes: But yet God is truly and juſtly ſaid to have deſtroyed thoſe Idolatrous Enemies, in that he brought them ſo low, as that they could not give Laws to the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> nor force them to the Idolatrous Worſhip of their gods, though ſome ſcattered Idolaters did ſtill live amongſt them. God could deſtroy <hi>Nequitias in coeleſtibus,</hi> he could evacuate all Powers and Principalities, he could annihilate the Devil, or he could put him out of Commiſſion, take from him the power of tempting or ſolliciting his ſervants. Though God hath not done it, yet he is properly ſaid to have deſtroyed him, becauſe he hath deſtroyed his Kingdom. <hi>Death is ſwallowed up in victory,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul</hi> out of <hi>Oſe. O death, where is thy ſting,</hi> ſays he! Where is it! Why,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.5.4. Oſe. 13.14.</note> it is in thy boſome. It is at the heart of the greateſt Princes of the earth; Though they be gods, they die like men. <hi>O grave, where is thy victory,</hi> ſays he there! Why, above the Victories, and Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies and Triumphs of all the Conquerors in the world. And yet
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:93368:167"/>
the Apoſtle ſpeaks, (and juſtly) as if there were no death in man, no ſting in death, no grave after death, becauſe to him who dies in the Lord, all this is nothing; not he by death, but death in him is deſtroyed. And as it is of the cauſe of Sin, the Devil; and of the effect of Sin, Death; ſo is it of Sin it ſelf; it is deſtroyed, and yet we ſin. <hi>He that is born of God, doth not commit ſin</hi> ſo, as that ſin ſhall be imputed to him. Sin and Satan, and Death are deſtroyed in us, becauſe they can do no harm to us. So the Idolatrous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were deſtroyed amongſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> becauſe they could not bring in an Inquiſition amongſt them, and force them to their Religion. And ſo Idolatry hath been deſtroyed amongſt us, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed ſo, as that it hath been declared to be Idolatry towards God, and declared to be complicated and wrapped up inſeparably in Treaſon towards the King and the State. Our Schools and Pulpits have deſtroyed it, and our Parliaments have deſtroyed it. Our Pulpits eſtabliſh them that ſtay at home; and our Laws are able to lay hold upon them that run from home, and return ill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to their home. Let no man therefore murmur at Gods proceedings, and ſay, If God had a minde to deſtroy Idolatry, he would have left no ſeed, or he would not have admitted ſuch are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pullulation, and ſuch a growth of that ſeed as he hath done. God hath his own ends and his own ways: He deſtroyed the Nations from before the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> Chriſt hath deſtroyed Sin, and Satan, and Death, and Hell; and Idolaters amongſt us, for Gods greater glory, do remain. For ſuch a deſtruction as ſhould be abſolute, God never intended, God never promiſed; for that were to occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and to induce a ſecurity, and remove all diligence: Which is our ſecond Branch in this firſt part <hi>[Cave tibi]</hi> ſee, take heed, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the world we preſume all things to have been produced in their beſt ſtate; all was perfect, and yet how ſoon a decay! all was ſummer, and yet how ſoon a fall of the leaf! a fall in Paradiſe, not of the leaf, but of the Tree it ſelf, <hi>Adam</hi> fell; A fall before that, in heaven it ſelf, Angels fell: Better ſecurity then <hi>Adam,</hi> then Angels had there, we cannot have, we cannot look for here. And therefore there is danger ſtill, ſtill occaſion of diligence,<note place="margin">Lev. 11.3.</note> of conſideration. The chewing of the Cudd was a diſtinctive mark of cleanneſs in the Creature: The holy rumination the daily conſideration of his Chriſtianity, is a good character of a Chriſtian.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.31.</note> 
               <hi>Covet earneſtly the beſt gifts,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle; thoſe to whom he writ had good gifts already, yet he exhorts them to a deſire of better And what doth he promiſe them? not the Gift it ſelf, but the way to it, <hi>I will ſhew a more excellent way.</hi> There is ſtill ſomething more excellent then we have yet attained to. <hi>Non dicit chariſma,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chryſoſt.</note> 
               <hi>ſed viam.</hi> The beſt ſtep, the beſt height in this world, is but the way to a better; and ſtill we have way before us to walk further in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Anathema pro fratribus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9.3.</note> was but once ſaid;
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:93368:167"/>
St. <hi>Paul</hi> once, and in a vehement, and inordinate zeal, and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſtemper ſaid ſo, That he <hi>could be content to be ſeparated from Chriſt. Exi à me Domine,</hi> was but once ſaid, once St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">Luc. 5.8.</note> 
               <hi>Depart from me, O Lord.</hi> The <hi>Anathema,</hi> the <hi>exi</hi> but once; but the <hi>Adveniat Regnum, Let thy Kingdom come,</hi> I hope is ſaid more then once by every one of us, every day; every day we receive, and yet every day we pray for that Kingdom, more and more aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Glory, by more and more increaſe of Grace. For as there are bodily diſeaſes, and ſpiritual diſeaſes too, proper to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ages, (a yong man and an old man are not ordinarily ſubject to the ſame diſtempers, nor to the ſame vices) ſo particular forms of Religion have their indiſpoſitions, their ill inclinations too. Thou art bred in a Reformed Church, where the truth of Chriſt is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely Preached, bleſs God for it; but even there thou mayeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract a pride, an opinion of purity, and uncharitably deſpiſe thoſe who labour yet under their ignorances or ſuperſtitions; or thou mayeſt grow weary of thy Manna, and ſmell after <hi>Egyptian</hi> Onions again. It is not enough that the State and the Church hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed Idolatry ſo far as we ſaid before; ſtill there are weeds, ſtill there are ſeeds: And therefore <hi>Cave,</hi> Take heed. But yet it is but, <hi>Take heed.</hi> It is not take thought. <hi>Afflict not thy ſelf,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject not thy ſelf with ominous preſages, and prophetical melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, thy God will overthrow this Religion, and deſtroy this work which his right hand hath been a hundred years in repairing, and ſcatter his corn which his right hand hath been a hundred years in purifying. Come not to ſay, It was but the paſſion and animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Luther,</hi> It was but the ambition and ſingularity of <hi>Calvin</hi> that induc'd this Religion, and now that that is ſpent, the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on melts like ſnow. Take no ſuch thought, be not afraid that the truth of God ſhall or can periſh: It is not, Take thought; but it is much leſs, Take arms. Men may have falſe conceptions of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, and ways laid towards a re-entry of Idolatry; and men may have juſt and true reaſons of, or religious indignation to ſee ſo bad and ſo inſolent uſes made of thoſe favours which are offered to perſons of that profeſſion; but yet our inhibition is no further here, but to take heed, not to take arms, not to come by violence, not to ſlackneſs of Allegiance and Obedience. It is but <hi>Take heed,</hi> and but <hi>Take heed to thy ſelf.</hi> Pretend not thou who art but a private man, to be an Overſeer of the Publick, or a Controller of him who (by way of coaction) is accountable to God only, and neither to any great Officer at home, nor to the whole body of the people there, nor to any neighbour-Prince or State abroad. Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry is deſtroyed; but yet there is danger, not to make thee take thought, to ſuſpect Gods Power, or his Will to ſuſtain his Cauſe; not to take arms, as if the Lord of Hoſts needed Rebels; but to take heed, to watch plots of circumvention, and to heed to thy ſelf,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:93368:168"/>
that is, to all under thy charge, for thy danger is not evident. It is a ſnare, <hi>Laqueus,</hi> which is our laſt ſtop and ſtep in this firſt part.</p>
            <p>There is danger though the Idolaters be thus deſtroyed. There is uſe of diligence, if there be danger, and the more, if this danger be a ſnare. Take heed that the Idolater do not kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle a Rebellion; take heed that the Idolater do not ſollicite an Invaſion; take heed of publick and general dangers. Theſe be Caveats for Princes; but take heed of a ſnake, take heed of a ſnare, this appertains to every private man.<note place="margin">Pſal. 11.6.</note> God ſtudied plagues for <hi>Egypt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">69.21.</note> and they were ſtrange plagues; but that's as great as any at leaſt, which <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Pluet laqueos, Upon the wicked God ſhall rain ſnares.</hi> And after, <hi>Menſa laqueus, Their table ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ſnare before them.</hi> And if God puniſh our negligence of his former favours ſo far, as to rain ſnares even at our tables, that almoſt at every table that we can come to, we ſhall meet ſome that would enſnare us, Is not this Caveat neceſſary in theſe times? <hi>Take heed that thou be not ſnared. David</hi> thought he had carried his complaint to the higheſt,<note place="margin">64.65.</note> when he ſaid of his Enemies, <hi>They commune of laying ſnares privily.</hi> But now they do not plot privily, but avow their miſchiefs, and ſpeak ſo, as we dare ſcarce confeſs that we heard them: And that's a ſhrewd ſnare, when they dare ſpeak more then we dare hear. <hi>Will a man have taken up a ſnare from the earth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Amos 3.5.</note> 
               <hi>and have taken nothing,</hi> ſaith the Prophet? Since they have laid their ſnares, they will take ſome, and thou mayeſt be one: And therefore take heed of their ſnares. There is a ſnare laid for thy ſon, a perſwaſion to ſend him to foreign Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities; they will ſay, Not to change his Religion: For Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, let him do as he ſhall ſee cauſe; but there he ſhall be better taught, and better bred then at home. There is a ſhare laid for thy ſervants, what need they come to Church, they have nothing to loſe, who will indite them, who will perſecute them? And yet in due time ſuch ſervants may do the Cauſe as much good as the Maſters. There is a ſnare laid for thy wife; Her Religion, ſay they, doth not hinder her husbands preferment, why ſhould ſhe refuſe to apply her ſelf to them? We have uſed to ſpeak proverbially of a Curtain Sermon, as of a ſhrewd thing; but a Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Maſs, a Curtain <hi>Requiem,</hi> a ſnare in thy bed; a ſnake in thy boſome is ſomewhat worſe. I know not what name we may give to ſuch a womans husband; but I am ſure ſuch a wife hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted adultery, Spiritual Adultery, and that with her husbands know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; call him what you will. There is a ſnare for thy ſervant, for thy ſon, for thy wife, and for thy fame too; and how far ſoever thou wert from it, they will have the world believe thou diedſt a Papiſt. If thy declination be towards profit, if thy byas turn that way, there is a ſnare in the likeneſs of a Chain, of a Jewel, a Penſion. If it be ſociety and converſation, there may be a ſnare in meeting
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:93368:168"/>
more good company at Maſſes, then at thy Pariſh Church. If it be levity, and affectation of new things, there may be a ſnare of things ſo new in that Religion, as that this Kingdom never ſaw them yet, not then when this Kingdom was of that Religion. For we had received the Reformation before the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and before the growth of the Jeſuits: And if we ſhould turn to them now, we ſhould be worſe then we were before we receiv'd the Reformation; and the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> and the Jeſuits have made that Religion worſe then it was;<note place="margin">Rom. 8.38.</note> as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſays upon St. <hi>Pauls</hi> words, <hi>Neither height, nor depth, nor life, nor death, ſhall ſeparate us: Minime tamen dicit, nec nos ipſi.</hi> The Apoſtle doth not ſay, that we our ſelves, and our own concupiſences ſhall not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate us from God. So though Excommunications have not, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions have not, Powder-Plots have not; yet God knows what thoſe ſnares may work upon us. <hi>In laqueo ſuo comprehendantur,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 9.16.</note> ſays <hi>David.</hi> Now <hi>laqueus</hi> is a ſnare, as their malice intends it for us; and <hi>laqueus</hi> is a halter, as our Laws intend it for them; and <hi>in laqueo ſuo,</hi> as it's theirs, let them be taken. Our good and great God in his power and mercy hath deſtroyed Idolatry; but in his wiſdom he hath left exerciſe for our diligence in ſome danger, and that danger is a ſnare, and therefore, <hi>Take heed thou be not ſnared.</hi> And ſo we have done with the firſt part.</p>
            <p>Our ſecond part conſiſts of two branches,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Part.</hi>
               </note> of two ways of falling into this danger. Firſt, by <hi>following them;</hi> and then, by <hi>inquiring into their Religion.</hi> For the firſt, the Original word which we tranſlate, <hi>following,</hi> is <hi>Achareihem,</hi> and it is only <hi>poſt eos, Come not after them;</hi> which (if we were to reflect at all, which we always avoid, upon publick things) would afford a good note for the publick, for the Magiſtrate, Come not after theſe Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but be ſtill beforehand with them. That which is prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bially ſaid of particular Bodies, will hold in a Body Politick, in any State. <hi>Qui medicè miſerè.</hi> That man hath no health, who is put to ſuſtain it, or repair it with continual Phyſick. That State hath no ſafety, that refers all to a defenſive War,<note place="margin">Luke 4.24.</note> and to a reparation of Breaches, then when they are made. That State will be ſubject to the other Proverb, which <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> foreſaw: <hi>Medice cura teipſum.</hi> That State which hath been a Phyſitian to all her neighbour States, let blood, and ſtaunched blood in them, ſo as conduced beſt to their own health, may be put to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all her means upon her ſelf, to repair and cure her ſelf, if ſhe <hi>follow,</hi> that is (in this acceptation of the word) <hi>come after her Idolatrous enemies,</hi> and be not ſtill beforehand with them. But that is not our ſphear, the Publick, the State; but yet States conſiſt of Families, and Families of private perſons, and they are in our ſphear, in our charge. And therefore we lay this Inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition upon all that are Maſters of Families, <hi>Take heed of being
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:93368:169"/>
ſnared by following,</hi> by coming after <hi>them,</hi> in this ſenſe. That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou thinkeſt thou haſt a power in thy wife, in thy children, in thy ſervants, and canſt do what thou wilt with them at any time, therefore thou needeſt not be ſo ſcrupulous at firſt, but mayſt admit any ſupplanters, any underminers into thy houſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are good company, or becauſe they have relation to great perſons. Come not to this, <hi>Poſt eos,</hi> play not that after-game, to put thy ſelf to a neceſſity of taking ſowre and unkinde courſes with wire and children after; but be beforehand with ſuch Idolaters, prevent their ſnare. We lay this Inhibition too upon every particular conſcience. <hi>Covetouſneſs is Idolatry,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, and <hi>Quot vitia, tot Idola,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Hierom.</hi> As many ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual ſins as we have, ſo many Idols have we ſet up. True repentance deſtroyes this Idolatry, 'tis true; but then, <hi>Take heed of being ſnared,</hi> poſt ea, <hi>by coming after them,</hi> by expoſing thy ſelf to dangers of relapſes again, by conſideration how eaſily thou madeſt thy peace laſt time with God. It was but a ſigh, but a tear, but a bending of the knee, but a receiving of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that went to it then. And <hi>poſt ea,</hi> when all is done which was done before in the way of ſin, all that is eaſily done over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, which was done in the way of remedy. Say not ſo: for a merry heart, and a chearful countenance, upon the teſtimony of a good conſcience, is a better way to God then all the dejections of Spirit, all the ſowre contritions, and ſad remorſes in the world. Thou art not ſure that thou ſhalt get ſo far, as to ſuch a ſadneſs as God requires for ſin, thou mayſt continue in thy preſumption. Thou art not ſure that thou ſhalt go no further then God requires, in that ſadneſs, it may flow out to deſperation. Be beforehand with thy ſins, watch the approaches of thoſe enemies; for if thou build upon that way of coming after them upon preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mercy, upon repentance, thou maiſt be ſnared, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>take heed.</hi> And this is the ſenſe of the phraſe, as the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal will afford it, with Idolaters in the State, with Underminers in thy Houſe, with ſins in thy Soul, be ſtill beforehand, watch their dangerous acceſſes. But St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> and the great ſtream of Expoſitors that go with him, give another ſenſe of the word, <hi>Ne imiteris, Be not ſnared by following them.</hi> And in that ſenſe we are to take the word now.</p>
            <p>Follow them not then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, imitate them not, neither in their Severity and Cruelty, nor in their Levity and Facility, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not in their Severity, when they will apply all the capital and bloody penalties of the Imperial Laws (made againſt <hi>Arrians, Manicheans, Pelagians,</hi> and <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> Hereticks in the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental points of Religion, and with which Chriſt could not conſiſt) to every man that denys any collateral and ſubdivided Tradition of theirs; that if a man conceive any doubt of the
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:93368:169"/>
dream of Purgatory, of the validity of indulgence, of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of a work of Supererogation, he is as deep in the fagot here, and ſhall be as deep in Hell hereafter, as if he denyed the Trinity, or the Incarnation and Paſſion of Chriſt Jeſus; when in a days warning, and by the roaring of one Bull, it grows to be damnation to day, to beleeve ſo as a man might have beleeved yeſterday, and have bin ſaved, when they will afford no Salvation, but in that Church which is diſcernable by certain and inſeparable marks, which our Country-man <hi>Saunders</hi> makes to be ſix, and <hi>Mich. Medina</hi> extends to eleven, and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> declares to be fifteen, and <hi>Bodius</hi> ſtretches to a hundred, when they make every thing Hereſie; and rather then lack a Text for putting Hereticks to death, will accept that falſe reading, <hi>haereticum hominem devita,</hi> which being ſpoken of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding,<note place="margin">Titus 3.10.</note> they will needs interpret of killing (for <hi>Eraſmus</hi> cites a Witneſs, who heard an antient and grave Divine cite that place ſo, and to that purpoſe) follow them not, do not imitate them; be content to judge more charitably of them. For thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them who are under an invincible ignorance (becauſe their Superiors keep the Scriptures from them) God may be pleaſed to ſave by that revelation of his Son Chriſt Jeſus, which he hath afforded them in that Church: Howſoever, they who have had light offered to them, and wilfully reſiſt it, muſt neceſſarily periſh. Follow them not, imitate them not in that ſeverity, neceſſarily to damn all who think not in all things as they do: Nor follow them not in that facility, to make their Divinity, and the Tenets of their Church, to wait upon temporal affairs, and emergent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. The <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> will delude the Magiſtrate in an examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or in any practiſe, becauſe he thinks no man ought to be a Magiſtrate over him in things that have any relation to ſpiritual Cognizance, and Treaſon in alienating the Subject from his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance muſt be of ſpiritual cognizance, Where others are too ſtrong for them, they may dignifie their Religion (ſo their Jeſuit <hi>Ribadineyra</hi> ſays) and where they are too ſtrong for others, they muſt profeſs it, though with Arms (ſo their Jeſuit <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues it.) In this planetary, in this tranſitory, in this occaſional Religion, follow them not: We ſay in Logick, <hi>Subſtantia non ſuſcipit magis &amp; minus,</hi> Subſtantial and fundamental points of Religion (and obedience to Superiors is amongſt thoſe) do not ebb and flow; they binde all men, and at all times, and in all caſes. <hi>Induite Dominum Jeſu,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Put ye on the Lord Jeſus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 13 14.</note> and keep him on, put him not off again. Chriſt is not only the Stuff, but the Garment ready made; he will not be tranſlated and turn'd, and put into new faſhions, nor laid up in a Wardrobe, but put on all day, all the days of our life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though it rain, and rain blood; how foul ſoever any perſecution make the day, we muſt
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:93368:170"/>
keep on that Garment, the true profeſſion of Chriſt Jeſus; fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low not theſe men in their ſeverity, to exclude men from ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in things that are not fundamental, nor in their facility to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe and prevaricate in things that are.</p>
            <p>The ſecond danger, and our laſt Branch of this laſt Part is, <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire not after their gods,</hi> &amp;c. Ignorance excuſes no man. What is curioſity?<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note> 
               <hi>Qui ſcire vult ut ſciat,</hi> He that deſires knowledge only that he may know, or be known by others to know; he who makes not the end of his knowledge the glory of God, he offends in curioſity, ſays that Father; But that is only in the end. But in the way to knowledge there is curioſity too; In ſeeking ſuch things as man hath no faculty to compaſs, unrevealed myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; In ſeeking things, which if they may be compaſſed, yet it is done by indirect means, by Invocation of Spirits, by Sorcery; In ſeeking things which may be found, and by good means, but appertain not to our profeſſion; all theſe ways men offend in curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity. It is ſo in us, in Church-men, <hi>ſi Iambos ſervemus, &amp; metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ſilvam congerimus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hieron.</note> If we be over-vehemently affected or tranſported with Poetry, or other ſecular Learning. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore St. <hi>Hierom</hi> is reported himſelf to have been whipt by an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, who found him over-ſtudious in ſome of <hi>Cicero's</hi> Books. This is curioſity in us, and it is ſo in you, if when you have ſufficient means of ſalvation Preached to you in that Religion wherein you were Baptized, you enquire too much, too much trouble your ſelf with the Religion of thoſe, from whoſe ſuperſtitions you are already by Gods goodneſs reſcued; remember that he who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to fill himſelf with the husks, was the Prodigal. It was Prodigality, and a dangerous expence of your conſtancy, to open your ſelf to temptation, by an unneceſſary enquiring into imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent controverſies. We in our profeſſion may embrace ſecular Learning, ſo far as it may conduce to the better diſcharge of our duties, in making the eaſier entrance, and deeper impreſſion of Divine things in you: You may inform your ſelves occaſionally, when any ſcruple takes hold of you, of any point of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But let your ſtudy be rather to live according to that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which you have, then to enquire into that from which God hath delivered you; for that's the looking back of <hi>Lots</hi> wife, and the diſtemper and diſtaſte of the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred too much the <hi>Egyptian</hi> diet. If you will enquire whether any of the Fathers of the Primitive Church did at any time pray for any of the dead, you ſhall be told (and truly) that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> did, that <hi>Ambroſe</hi> did; but you ſhall not ſo preſently be told how they deprehended themſelves in an infirmity, and collected and corrected themſelves ever when they were ſo praying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If you enquire whether any of them ſpeak of Purgatory, you ſhall eaſily finde they do; but not ſo eaſily, in what ſenſe; when they call the
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:93368:170"/>
calamities of this life, or when they call the general Conflagrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world, Purgatory. If you enquire after Indulgences, you may finde the name frequent amongſt them; but not ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finde when and how the Relaxations of Penances publickly enjoyned, were called Indulgences; nor how, nor when Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces came to be applyed to ſouls departed. If thou enquire with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>Melius Inquirendum,</hi> without a through Inquiſition (which is not eaſie for any man who makes it not his whole ſtudy and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion) thou maiſt come to think holy men have pray'd for the dead, why may not I? Holy men ſpeak of Purgatory and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, why ſhould I abhor the names or the things? And ſo thou maiſt fall into the firſt ſnare, it hath been done, therefore it may be done; and into another after, It may be done, therefore it muſt be done: When thou art come to think that ſome men are ſaved that have done it, thou wilt think that no man can be ſaved except he do it: From making infirmities excuſable neceſſary (which is the bondage the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath laid upon the world) to make Problematical things, Dogmatical; and matter of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputation, matter of Faith; to bring the Univerſity into <hi>Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> and heaps of Arguments into Piles of Faggots. If thou enquire further then thy capacity enables thee, further then thy calling provokes thee; How do thoſe Nations ſerve their gods? thou maiſt come to ſay, as the Text ſays, in the end, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo will I do alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To end all, embrace Fundamental, Dogmatical, evident Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: That is expreſs'd <hi>in Credendis,</hi> in the things which we are to believe in the Creed. And it begins with <hi>Credo in Deum,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in God, and not in man, nor traditions of men. And it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed <hi>in petendis,</hi> in the things which we are to pray for in the Lords Prayer; and that begins with <hi>Sanctificetur nomen tuum, Hallowed be thy Name,</hi> not the name of any. And it is expreſſed <hi>in Agendis,</hi> in the things which we are to do in the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; whereof the firſt Table begins with that, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other gods but me.</hi> God is a Monarch alone, not a Conſul with a Colleague. And the ſecond Table begins with Honor to Parents, that is, to Magiſtrates, to lawful Authority. Be therefore always fat from diſobeying lawful Authority, reſiſt it not, calumniate it not, ſuſpect it not; for there is a libelling in the ear, and a libelling in the heart, though it come not to the tongue or hands, to words, nor actions. <hi>If it be poſsible,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>as much as in you lies, have peace with all men,</hi> with all kind of men. Obedience is the firſt Commandment of the ſecond Table, and that never deſtroys the firſt Table, of which the firſt Commandment is, Keep thy ſelf, that is, thoſe that belong to thee and thy houſe, intire and upright in the worſhip of the true God, not only not to admit Idols for gods, but not to admit Idolatry in the worſhip of the true God.</p>

            <p>THat Man that ſaid it was poſſible to carve the faces of all good Kings that ever were, in a Cherry-ſtone, had a ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and a trayterous meaning in his words. And he that thought it a good deſcription, a good Character of <hi>good ſubjects,</hi> that they were <hi>Populus natus ad ſervitutem,</hi> A people diſpoſed to bear any ſlaviſh yoak, had a tyrannical meaning in his words. But in this Text, as in one of thoſe Tables, in which, by changing the ſtation, and the line, you uſe to ſee two pictures, you have a good picture of a good King, and of a good ſubject; for in one line, you ſee ſuch a ſubject, as <hi>Loves pureneſs of heart,</hi> and <hi>hath grace in his lips.</hi> In the other line, you ſee the King gracious, yea friendly to ſuch a ſubject, <hi>He that loveth pureneſs of heart, for the grace of his lips, the King ſhall be his friend.</hi> The ſum of the words, is, that God will make an honeſt man acceptable to the King, for ſome ability, which he ſhall employ to the publike. Him that proceeds ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a lawful calling, God will bleſs and proſper, and he will ſeal this bleſſing to him, even with that which is his own ſeal, his own image, the favor of the King, <hi>He that loveth pureneſs of heart, for the grace of his lips, the King ſhall be his friend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We will not be curious in placing theſe two pictures, nor conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering which to conſider firſt. As he that would vow a faſt, till he had found in nature, whether the Egge, or the Hen were firſt in the world, might perchance ſtarve himſelf; ſo that King, or that
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:93368:171"/>
ſubject, which would forbear to do their ſeveral duties,<note place="margin">Serm. 24.</note> till they had found which of them were moſt neceſſary to one another, might ſtarve one another; for, King and ſubjects are Relatives, and cannot be conſidered in execution of their duties, but toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The greateſt Myſtery in Earth, or Heaven, which is <hi>the Trinity,</hi> is conveyed to our underſtanding, no other way, then ſo, as they have reference to one another <hi>by Relation,</hi> as we ſay in the Schools; for, God could not be a father without a Son, nor the Holy Ghoſt <hi>Spiratus ſine ſpirante.</hi> As in Divinity, ſo in Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity too, <hi>Relations</hi> conſtitute one another, King and ſubject come at once and together into conſideration. Neither is it ſo perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent a conſideration, which of them was made for others ſake, as that they were both made for Gods ſake, and equally bound to advance his glory.</p>
            <p>Here in our Text, we finde the ſubjects picture firſt;<note place="margin">Diviſio.</note> And his Marks are two; firſt, <hi>Pureneſs of Heart,</hi> That he be an <hi>honeſt</hi> Man; And then <hi>Grace of lips,</hi> that he be good for ſomething; for, by this phraſe, <hi>Grace of lips,</hi> is expreſſed every ability, to do any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of ſociety for the Publike good. The firſt of theſe, <hi>Pureneſs of heart,</hi> he muſt <hi>love;</hi> The other, that is, <hi>Grace of lips</hi> (that is, other Abilities) he muſt <hi>have,</hi> but he muſt not be in love with them, nor over-value them. In the Kings picture, the principal marke is, That he ſhall be friendly and gracious; but gracious to him that hath this <hi>Grace of lips,</hi> to him that hath endeavored, in ſome way, to be of uſe to the Publike; And, not to him neither, for all the grace of his lips, for all his good parts, except he alſo <hi>love pureneſs of heart;</hi> but, <hi>He that loveth pureneſs of heart</hi> (There's the foundation) <hi>for the grace of his lips</hi> (There's the upper-build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) <hi>the King ſhall be his friend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt then, which is this Pureneſs of heart, we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider <hi>Rem, ſedem, &amp; Modum; what</hi> this Pureneſs is,<note place="margin">Part. <hi>1.</hi> Puritas.</note> Then <hi>where</hi> it is to be lodged and fixed, In the heart; and, after that, the way, and means by which this Pureneſs of heart is acquired and preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which is implyed and notified in that Affection, wherewith this pureneſs of heart is to be embraced and entertained, which is <hi>love;</hi> For, Love is ſo noble, ſo ſoveraign an Affection, as that it is due to very few things, and very few things worthy of it. Love is a Poſſeſſory Affection, it delivers over him that loves into the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of that that he loves; it is a tranſmutatory Affection, it changes him that loves, into the very nature of that that he loves, and he is nothing elſe.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, <hi>Pureneſs</hi> it ſelf; It is carried to a great heighth,<note place="margin">Res.</note> for our imitation (God knows, too great for our imitation) when Chriſt bids us <hi>be perfect,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 5.48.</note> 
               <hi>even as our father which is in heaven is perfect.</hi> As though it had not been perfectneſs enough, to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as <hi>the Son upon earth</hi> was perfect; he carries us higher, <hi>Be
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:93368:172"/>
perfect as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.</hi> The Son, upon Earth, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> had all our infirmities, and imperfections upon him, hunger, and wearineſs, and hearty ſorrow to death, and that, which alone is All, Mortality, Death it ſelf. And, though he were Innocence it ſelf, and knew no ſin, yet there was no ſin that he knew not, for, all our ſins were his. He was not onely made Man, and by taking (by <hi>Admitting,</hi> though not by Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting) our ſins, as well as our nature, <hi>ſinful</hi> Man; but he was made <hi>ſin</hi> for our ſakes. And therefore, though he ſay of himſelf, <hi>ſicut ego,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 15.10.</note> 
               <hi>Keep my Commandements, even as I have kept my fathers Commandements,</hi> yet ſtill he refers all originally to the Father; and becauſe he was under our infirmities and our iniquities, he never ſays (though he might well have ſaid ſo) <hi>ſicut ego,</hi> Be pure, be perfect as I am perfect and pure, but <hi>ſicut Pater,</hi> be pure as your Father in heaven is pure. Hand to hand with the Father, Chriſt diſclaims himſelf,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.39.</note> diſavows himſelf, <hi>Non ſicut ego, Nevertheleſs, not as I will, but as thou wilt, O Father.</hi> We are not referr'd for the pattern of our purity (though we might be ſafely) to him that came from heaven, The Son, but to him which is in heaven, The Father. Nor to <hi>the Sun</hi> which is in heaven (the Sun, that is the pure fountain of all natural light) nor to the Angels which are in heaven, though they be pure in their Nature, and refined by a continual emanation of the beams of glory upon them, from the face of God, but, the Father which is in heaven is made the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of our purity; That ſo, when we ſee the exact purity, which we ſhould aim at, and labor for, we might the more ſeriouſly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the more ſtudiouſly endeavor the amendment of that extreme and enormous fouleneſs and impurity, in which we who ſhould be pure, as our Father which is in heaven is pure, exceed <hi>the dog</hi> that turns to his own vomit again;<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.22.</note> and <hi>the Sow,</hi> that was waſhed, to her wallowing in the mire.</p>
            <p>Yet there is no foulneſs ſo foul, ſo inexcuſable in the eys of God, nor that ſhall ſo much aggravate our condemnation, as a falſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation, and an hypocritical counterfeiting of this Purity. There is a Pureneſs, a cleanneſs imagin'd (rather dream't of) in the <hi>Romane Church,</hi> by which (as their words are) the ſoul is abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not onely <hi>à Paſsionibus,</hi> but <hi>â Phantaſmatibus,</hi> not onely from paſſions, and perturbations, but from the ordinary way of coming to know any thing; The ſoul (ſay they) of men ſo puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, underſtands no longer, <hi>per phantaſmata rerum corporalium;</hi> not by having any thing preſented by the fantaſie to the ſenſes, and ſo to the underſtanding, but altogether by a familiar conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with God, and an immediate revelation from God; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Chriſt himſelf contented himſelf with the ordinary way; He was hungry,<note place="margin">Mat. 21.20.</note> and a fig-tree preſented it ſelf to him upon the way, and he went to it to eat. This is that Pureneſs in the <hi>Romane
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:93368:172"/>
Church,</hi> by which the founder of the laſt Order amongſt them, <hi>Philip Nerius,</hi> had not onely utterly emptied his heart of the world, but had fill'd it too full of God; for,<note place="margin">Congrega. Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</note> ſo (ſay they) he was fain to cry ſometimes, <hi>Recede ame Domine,</hi> O Lord go farther from me, and let me have a leſs portion of thee. But who would be loath to ſink, by being over-fraited with God, or loath to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ſet, by having ſo much of that winde, the breath of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God? Privation of the preſence of God, is Hell; a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of it, is a ſtep toward it. Fruition of his preſence is Heaven; and ſhall any Man be afraid of having too much Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, too much God? There are many among them, that are over laden, oppreſſed with <hi>Biſhropricks</hi> and <hi>Abbeys,</hi> and yet they can bear it and never cry, <hi>Retrahe domine, domine Reſume,</hi> O Lord withdraw from me, <hi>Reſume</hi> to thy ſelf ſome of theſe ſuperabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancies; and ſhall we think any of them to be ſo over-fraited and ſurcharg'd with the preſence, and with the grace of God, as to be put to his <hi>Recede domine,</hi> O Lord withdraw thy ſelf, and leſſen thy grace towards me? This Pureneſs is not in their heart, but in their fantaſie.</p>
            <p>We read in the Eccleſiaſtick ſtory of ſuch a kinde of affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſingularity, very early in the primitive Church.<note place="margin">Catharſitae.</note> We finde two ſorts of falſe <hi>Puritans</hi> then; The <hi>Cathariſts,</hi> and <hi>The Cathari.</hi> The <hi>Cathariſts</hi> thought no creatures of God pure, and therefore they brought in ſtrange ceremonial purifications of thoſe Creatures. In which error, they of the <hi>Romane Church</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed them, in a great part, in their <hi>Exorciſmes,</hi> and <hi>Conſecrations;</hi> Particularly in the greateſt matter of all, in the <hi>Sacraments.</hi> For, the <hi>Cathariſts</hi> in the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, thought not the bread pure, except it were purified by the aſperſion of ſomething iſſuing from the body of man, not fit to be nam'd here; And ſo, in the <hi>Romane Church,</hi> they induc'd a uſe of another Excrement in the other Sacrament, They muſt have <hi>ſpittle</hi> in the Sacrament of Baptiſme. For, in thoſe words of <hi>Tertullian,</hi>

            <p>The ſecond ſort of primitive <hi>Puritans,</hi> the <hi>Cathari,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cathari.</note> They thought no men pure but themſelves, and themſelves they thought ſo pure, as to have no ſin; and that therefore they might and ſo did, leave out, as an impertinent clauſe in the Lords pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that petition, <hi>Dimitte nobis debita noſtra,</hi> for, they thought they ought God nothing.

In ſpiritual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes it is otherwiſe; for, for this ſecond kinde of Puritans, that attribute all purity to themſelves, and ſpend all their thoughts upon conſidering others, that weed hath grown ſo far, that whereas thoſe Puritans of the Primitive Church did but refuſe to ſay, <hi>Dimitte nobis, Forgive us our treſpaſſes,</hi> becauſe they had no ſin, the <hi>Puritan Papiſt</hi> is come to ſay, <hi>Recede a nobis,</hi> O Lord ſtand farther off, for I have too much of thee.

Theſe two kinds of falſe Puritans we finde in the Primitive Church; And Satan, who laſts ſtill, makes them laſt ſtill too. But if we ſhall imagine a third ſort of Puritans, and make men afraid of the zeal of the glory of God, make men hard, and inſenſible of thoſe wounds that are inflicted upon Chriſt Jeſus, in blaſphemous oaths, and execrations, make men aſhamed to put a difference between <hi>the Sabbath</hi> and an ordinary day, and ſo, at laſt make ſin an indifferent matter, <hi>If any man liſt to be contentious we have no ſuch cuſtome,</hi>

howſoever the reward (the ſight of God) in the perfect fruition thereof may be reſerved for the future <hi>(They ſhall ſee God)</hi> yet they are pure, and they are bleſſed already, <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart.</hi> This pureneſs then muſt be rightly plac'd; for, in many things, the place qualifies and denominates the things; it is not <hi>Balſamum</hi> if it grew not in Paleſtine. It is not pureneſs, if it grew not in the Heart. The Hypocrite is the miſerableſt of all other; he does God ſervice, and yet is damned. The ſhedding of our blood for God is not a greater ſervice then the winning of ſouls to God; and the Hypocrite many times does that; his outward purity works upon them who cannot know it to be counterfeit, and draws them truely and ſincerely to ſerve God. He does God ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and yet periſhes,<note place="margin">1 Reg. 14.10.</note> becauſe he does it not from the heart.

            <p>It is not pureneſs then, except it be in the right place, the heart; But where is the heart? The heart is <hi>vafrum &amp; inſcrutabile, Deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful above all things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 17.9.</note> 
               <hi>and deſperately wieked, who can know it?</hi> It is uncertain and unſearchable; And it is ſo, becauſe it purſues thoſe things which are <hi>in fluxu,</hi> ever in motion. Caſt but a paper into the river, and fix thine eye upon that paper, and binde thine eye to follow that paper whitherſoever the river, or the winde ſhall carry
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:93368:174"/>
it, and thou canſt not imagine where thine eye will be to morrow: For, this paper is not addreſſed, as a ſhip, to a certain port, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any certain purpoſe, but expos'd to the diſpoſition of the tyde to the rage of the winde, to the wantonneſs of the Eddy, and to innumerable contingencies, till it wear out to nothing. So, if a man ſet his heart (we cannot call it a ſetting) if a man ſuffer his heart to iſſue upon any of theſe fluid and tranſitory things of this world, he ſhall have <hi>cor vafrum, &amp; inſcrutabile,</hi> He ſhall not know where to finde his own heart. If <hi>Riches</hi> be this floating paper that his eye is fixed upon, he ſhall not know upon what courſe; If <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> be this paper, he ſhall not know upon what face; If <hi>Honor</hi> and <hi>preferment</hi> be it, he ſhall not know upon what faction his heart will be tranſported a month hence. But, if the heart can fix it ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that which is fixt, the Almighty and immoveable God, if it can be content to inquire after it ſelf, and take knowledge where it is, and in what way, it will finde the means of cleanſing; And ſo, this ſecond conſideration, The placing of this pureneſs in the heart, enlarges it ſelf alſo into the third branch of this part, which is <hi>De Modo,</hi> by what means this pureneſs is fix'd in the heart, in which is involved the Affection with which it muſt be embrac'd, <hi>Love, He that loveth pureneſs of heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Both theſe then are ſetled; Our heart is naturally foul;<note place="margin">Modus.</note> And our heart may be cleanſed. But how, is our preſent diſquiſition, <hi>Who can bring a clean thing out of filthineſs? There is not one:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 14.4.</note> 
               <hi>Adam</hi> foul'd my heart and all yours; nor can we make it clean our ſelves, <hi>Who can ſay I have made clean my heart?</hi> There is but one way;<note place="margin">Prov. 20.9.</note> a poor beggarly way, but eaſie and ſure, to ask it of God. And, even to God himſelf it ſeems a hard work to cleanſe this heart; and therefore our prayer muſt be with <hi>David, Cor mundum crea, Create,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 51.12.</note> 
               <hi>O Lord, a pure heart in me.</hi> And then comes Gods part, not that Gods part begun but then; for it was his doing, that thou madeſt this prayer; but becauſe it is a work that God does eſpecially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in, to build upon his own foundations; when he hath diſpoſed thee to pray, and upon that prayer created a new heart in thee, then God works upon that new heart, and <hi>By faith purifyes it,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 15.9.</note> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables it to preſerve the pureneſs, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks. He had kindled ſome ſparks of this faith in thee, before thou askedſt that new heart; elſe the prayer had not been of faith; but now finding thee obſequious to his beginnings, he fuels this fire, and purifies thee, as Gold and Silver, in all his furnaces; through <hi>Believing</hi> and <hi>Doing,</hi> and <hi>ſuffering,</hi> through <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>works,</hi> and <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation,</hi> we come to this pureneſs of heart. And truely, he that lacks but the laſt, but Tribulation (as fain as we would be without it) lacks one concoction, one refining of this heart.</p>

               </hi> as it is truly ſaid, that land overflow'd with ſea, is <hi>all ſea.</hi> And when ſin hath got a heart in us, it will quickly come to be that whole <hi>Body of Death,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7.24.</note> which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> complains of, who ſhall deliver me from the Body of this Death? when it is a heart, it will get a <hi>Braine;</hi> a Brain that ſhall miniſter all <hi>Senſe,</hi> and <hi>Delight</hi> in ſin; That's the office of the Brain; A Brain which ſhall ſend for the ſinews and ligaments, to tye ſins together; and pith and marrow to give a ſucculencie, and nouriſhment, even to the bones, to the ſtrength and obduration of ſin; and ſo it ſhall do all thoſe ſervices, and offices for ſin, that the brain does to the natural bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. So alſo if ſin get to be a heart, it will get a <hi>liver</hi> to carry blood and life through all the body of our ſinful actions; That's the office of the liver; And whilſt we diſpute whether the throne and ſeat of the ſoul be in the Heart, or Brain, or Liver, this tyrant ſin will praeoccupate all, and become all; ſo, as that we ſhall finde nothing in us without ſin, nothing in us but ſin, if our heart be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt, inhabited by it. And if it be true in our natural bodies, that the heart is that part that lives firſt and dyes laſt, it is much truer of this <hi>Cor peccati,</hi> this heart of ſin; for, this hearty ſinner that hath given his heart to his ſin, doth no more foreſee a Death of that ſin in himſelf, then he remembers the Birth of it; and, becauſe he remembers not, or underſtands not how his ſoul contracted ſin, by coming into his body, he leaves her to the ſame ignorance, how ſhe ſhall diſcharge her ſelf of ſin, when ſhe goes out of that body. But, as his ſin is elder then himſelf (for <hi>Adams</hi> ſin is his ſin) ſo is it longer liv'd then his body, for it ſhall cleave everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to his ſoul too. God asks no more of thee, but, <hi>fili da mihi cor,</hi>

               <hi>My ſon give me thy heart;</hi> Becauſe when God gave it thee, it was but one heart.

<pb n="331" facs="tcp:93368:175"/>
this pureneſs of heart, to become once in a good ſtate, to have (as it were) paid all thy former debts, and ſo to be the better able to look about thee for the future, for prevention of ſubſequent ſins, which is the other way that we propoſed for attaining this pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, deteſtation of former habits, watchfulneſs upon particular actions.</p>
            <p>Till this be done, till this <hi>Cor peccati,</hi>

The great Engineir would have undertaken to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the World with his Engine, if there had been any place to fix his Engine upon, out of the World; I would undertake, (by Gods bleſſing upon his Ordinance) to cleanſe the fouleſt heart that is, if that Engine which God hath put into my hands might enter into his heart; if there were room for the renouncing Gods Judgements, and for the application of Gods mercies in the merits of Chriſt Jeſus in his heart, they would infallibly work upon him. But he hath petrified his heart in ſin, and then he hath immur'd it, wall'd it with a delight in ſin, and fortified it with a juſtifying of his ſin, and adds daily more and more out-works, by more and more daily ſins; ſo that the denouncing of Judgement, the application of Mercies, Prayers, Sermons, Sacraments, (which are the Engines and Ammunition which God hath put into our hands) though they have a bleſſed and a powerful opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and produce heavenly effects, where they may have entrance; in this, habitual ſinners can have none. Some things therefore, ſome great things every man muſt depart with, before he can come to the God of <hi>pure eyes.</hi>

            <p>When the heart is emptied of <hi>infidelity,</hi> and of thoſe habits of ſin that filled it, when it is come to a diſcontinuance, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of thoſe ſins, then we can better look into every corner, and endeavor to keep it clean; clean in that meaſure, that the God of <hi>pure eyes</hi> will vouchſafe to look upon it, and the light of his countenance will perfect the work. The diligence required on our part, is a ſerious watchfulneſs and conſideration of our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular actions, how ſmall ſoever. In the Law, whatſoever was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean to eat, made a man unclean, to <hi>touch</hi> it, when <hi>it</hi> was <hi>dead.</hi> Though the body of ſin have ſo far received a deadly wound in thee, as that thou haſt diſcontinued ſome habitual ſin, ſome long time; yet if thou touch upon the <hi>memory</hi> of that dead ſin, <hi>with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,</hi> thou begetteſt a new childe of ſin.<note place="margin">65.20.</note> And as <hi>Eſai</hi> ſpeaks of a childe, and of a ſinner of an hundred years old, ſo every ſin into which we relapſe, is born an hundred years old; it hath all the age of that ſin, which we had repented and diſcontinued before, upon it; it is born an <hi>Adam,</hi> in full ſtrength the firſt minute; born a Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, born a Devil, and poſſeſſes us in an inſtant. Every man may
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:93368:176"/>
obſerve, that a <hi>ſin of relapſe</hi> is ſooner upon him, then the ſame ſin was at the firſt attempting him; at firſt, he had more baſhfulneſs, more tenderneſs, more colluctation againſt the ſin, then upon a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe. And therefore in this ſurvey of ſin, thy firſt care muſt be, to take heed of returning top diligently to a remembrance of thoſe delightful ſins which are paſt; for that will endanger new. And in many caſes it is ſafer to do (as God himſelf is ſaid to do) <hi>to tie</hi> up <hi>our ſins</hi> in <hi>a bundle,</hi> and <hi>caſt them into the ſea;</hi> ſo for us to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent our ſins in general to God, and to caſt them into the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſea of the infinite mercies of God, in the infinite merits of Chriſt Jeſus; then by an over-diligent enumeration of ſins of ſome kindes, or by too buſie a contemplation of thoſe circumſtances which encreaſed our ſinful delignt then when we committed thoſe ſins, to commit them over again, by a freſh delight in their memory. When thou haſt truly repented them, and God hath forgotten them, do <hi>thou forget</hi> them too.</p>
            <p>The pureneſs and cleanneſs of heart which we muſt love, was evidently repreſented in the old Law, and in the practiſe of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who took knowledge of ſo many <hi>uncleanneſſes;</hi> they reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on almoſt fifty ſorts of uncleanneſſes, to which there belonged particular expiations; of which, ſome were hardly to be avoided in ordinary converſation: As to enter into the Courts of Juſtice; for the <hi>Jews</hi> that led Chriſt into the common Hall, would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, leſt they ſhould be defiled.<note place="margin">Jo. 18.28.</note> Yea, ſome things defiled them, which it had been unnatural to have left undone; as for the ſon to aſſiſt at his fathers Funeral; and yet even theſe required an expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For theſe, though they had not the nature of ſin, but might be expiated, (without any inward ſorrow or repentance) by outward ablutions, by ceremonial waſhings, within a certain time preſcribed by the Law, yet if that time were negligently and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderately overſlipt, then they became ſins, and then they could not be expiated, but by a more ſolemn, and a more coſtly way, by ſacrifice. And even before they came to that, whilſt they were <hi>but uncleanneſſes,</hi> and <hi>not ſins,</hi> yet even then they made them incapable of eating the Paſchal Lamb. So careful was God in the Law, and the <hi>Jews</hi> in their practiſe (for theſe outward things) to preſerve this pureneſs, this cleanneſs, even in things which were not fully ſins. So alſo muſt he that affects this pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, and ſtudies the preſerving of it, ſweep down every cobweb that hangs about it. Scurrile and obſcene language; yea, miſ-interpretable words, ſuch as may bear an ill ſenſe; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſureable converſation, and all ſuch little entanglings, which though he think too weak to hold him, yet they foul him. And let him that is ſubject to theſe <hi>ſmaller ſins,</hi> remember, that as a ſpider builds always where he knows there is moſt acceſs and haunt of flies, ſo the Devil that hath caſt theſe light cobwebs into thy
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:93368:176"/>
heart, knows that that heart is made of vanities and levities; and he that gathers into his treaſure whatſoever thou waſt'ſt out of thine, how negligent ſoever thou be, he keeps thy reckoning ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, and will produce againſt thee at laſt as many laſcivious glaunces as ſhall make up an Adultery, as many covetous wiſhes as ſhall make up a Robery, as many angry words as ſhall make up a Murder; and thou ſhalt have dropt and crumbled away thy ſoul, with as much irrecoverableneſs, as if thou hadſt poured it out all at once; and thy merry ſins, thy laughing ſins, ſhall grow to be crying ſins, even in the ears of God; and though thou drown thy ſoul here, drop after drop, it ſhall not burn ſpark after ſpark, but have all the fire, and all at once, and all eternally, in one intire and intenſe torment. For, as God, for our capacity, is content to be deſcribed as one of us, and to take our paſſions upon him, and be called <hi>angry,</hi> and <hi>ſorry,</hi> and the like; ſo is he in this alſo like us, that he takes it worſe to be ſlighted, to be neglected, to be left out, then to be actually injur'd. Our inconſideration, our not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God in our actions, offends him more then our ſins. We know, that in Nature, and in Art, the ſtrongeſt bodies are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact of the leaſt particles, becauſe they ſhut beſt, and lie cloſeſt together; ſo be the ſtrongeſt habits of ſin compact of ſins which in themſelves are leaſt; becauſe they are leaſt perceived, they grow upon us inſenſibly, and they cleave unto us inſeparably. And I ſhould make no doubt of recovering him ſooner that had ſinned long againſt his conſcience, though in a great ſin, then him that had ſinned leſs ſins, without any ſenſe or conſcience of thoſe ſins; for I ſhould ſooner bring the other to a deteſtation of his ſin, then bring this man to a knowledge, that that that he did was ſin. But if thou could'ſt conſider that every ſin is a Crucifying of Chriſt, and every ſin is a precipitation of thy ſelf from a Pinacle; were it a convenient phraſe to ſay, in every little ſin, that thou would'ſt <hi>Crucifie Chriſt a little,</hi> or break thy neck a little.</p>
            <p>Beloved, there is a power in <hi>grace,</hi> upon thy repentance, to waſh away thy greateſt ſins; that's the true, the proper Phyſick of the ſoul, it is the only means to recover thee. But yet, wert thou not better to make this grace thy diet, then thy phyſick? Wert thou not better to nouriſh thy ſoul with this grace all the way, then to hope to purge thy ſoul with it at laſt? This, as a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, the Apoſtle preſcribes thee, <hi>Whether you eat or drink, do all to the glory of God.</hi> He intends it farther there, <hi>Whatſoever you do;</hi> and farther then that, in another place, <hi>Whatſoever ye do,</hi> in <hi>deed,</hi>

And therefore, if you have not given
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:93368:177"/>
over all love of true weights, and true meaſures, weigh and meaſure your particular and <hi>indifferent actions,</hi> before you do them, and you ſhall ſee, at leaſt, grains of iniquity in them; and then, this advantage will you have, by this preconſideration, and weighing your actions before hand; that when you know there is ſin in that action, and know that nothing can counterpoiſe, nor weigh down ſin, but onely the Blood of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> you may know too, that the Blood of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> cannot be had before hand. God gives no ſuch <hi>non-obſtantes,</hi> no ſuch privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, no leave to ſin, no pardon for ſin, before it be committed: And therefore, if this premeditation of this action bring thee to ſee that there is ſin in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it muſt neceſſarily put a tenderneſs, a horror, an averſion in thee, from doing that, to which, (being thus done with this preconſideration, and preſumption) the Blood of thy Saviour doth not appertain. To all your other Wares, the baſer and courſer they are, the greater weight and meaſure you are content to give; to the baſeſt of all, to ſin, you give the lighteſt weight, and ſcanteſt meaſure, and you ſupply all with the excuſes of the cuſtom of the time, that the neceſſity of your trade forces you to it, elſe you ſhould be poor, and poorly thought of.</p>
            <p>Beloved, God never puts his children to a perplexity; to a neceſſity of doing any ſin, how little ſoever, though for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding of a ſin, as manifold as <hi>Adams.</hi> It is not a little requeſt to you, to beware of little ſins: It is not a little requeſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I make it, in the words of the greateſt to the greateſt, (for they are all one Head and Body) of Chriſt to his Church,<note place="margin">Cant. 2.15.</note>

               <hi>Love,</hi> in Divinity, is ſuch an attribute, or ſuch a notion, as deſigns to us one perſon in the Trinity; and that perſon who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates, and applies to us,<note place="margin">Amor.</note> the other two perſons, that is, <hi>The Holy Ghoſt:</hi> So that, as there is no <hi>power,</hi> but with relation to the <hi>Father,</hi> nor <hi>wiſdom</hi> but with relation to the <hi>Son,</hi> ſo there ſhould be no <hi>love</hi> but in the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> from whom comes this pureneſs of heart, and conſequently the love of it neceſſarily: For, the love of this pureneſs is part of this pureneſs it ſelf, and no man hath it, except he love it. All love which is placed upon lower things, admits ſatiety; but this love of this pureneſs, always grows, always proceeds: It does not onely file off the ruſt of our hearts, in purging us of old habits, but proceeds to a daily poliſhing of the heart, in an exact watchfulneſs, and brings us to that brightneſs,<note place="margin">Auguſtine.</note>

               <hi>Thy love to me was wonderful, paſsing the love of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:</hi> A love above that love, is wonderful. Now, this love between man and woman, doth ſo much confeſs a ſatiety, as that if a woman think to hold a man long, ſhe provides her ſelf ſome other capacity, ſome other title, then meerly as ſhe is a woman: Her wit, and her converſation, muſt continue this love; and ſhe muſt be a <hi>wife,</hi> a <hi>helper;</hi> elſe, meerly as a woman, this love muſt neceſſarily have intermiſſions. And therefore St. <hi>Jerome</hi> notes a cuſtom of his time,<note place="margin">Jerome.</note> (perchance prophetically enough of our times too) that to uphold an unlawful love, and make it continue, they uſed to call one another <hi>Friend,</hi> and <hi>Siſter,</hi> and <hi>Couſen, Ut etiam peccatis induant nomina caritatis,</hi> that they might apparel ill affections in good names; and thoſe names of natural and civil love might carry on, and continue a work, which otherwiſe would ſooner have withered. In Parables, and in Mythology, and in the application of Fables, this affection of love, for the often change of ſubjects, is deſcribed to have <hi>wings;</hi> whereas the true nature of a good love (ſuch as the love of this Text) is a conſtant union. But our love of earthly things is not ſo good as to be <hi>volatilis,</hi> apt to fly; for it is always groveling
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:93368:178"/>
upon the earth, and earthly objects: As in ſpiritual fornications, the Idols are ſaid to have ears and hear not, and eyes and ſee not; ſo in this idolatrous love of the Creature, love hath wings, and flies not; it flies not upward, it never aſcends to the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Creator, in the Creature. The <hi>Poets</hi> afford us but one Man, that in his love flew ſo high as the Moon; <hi>Endymion</hi> loved the Moon. The ſphear of our loves is ſublunary, upon things naturally inferior to our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Let none of this be ſo miſtaken, as though women were thought improper for divine, or for civil converſation: For, they have the ſame ſoul; and of their good uſing the faculties of that ſoul, the Eccleſiaſtick ſtory, and the Martyrologies, give us abundant examples of great things done, and ſuffered by women for the advancement of Gods glory: But yet, as when the woman was taken out of man, God cauſed a heavy ſleep to fall upon man,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.22.</note> and he ſlept; ſo doth the Devil caſt a heavy ſleep upon him too. When the woman is ſo received into man again, as that ſhe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes him, fills him, tranſports him. I know the Fathers are frequent in comparing and paralleling <hi>Eve,</hi> the Mother of Man, and <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of God. But, God forbid any ſhould ſay, That the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> concurred to our good, ſo, as <hi>Eve</hi> did to our ruine. It is ſaid truly, <hi>That as by one man ſin entred, and death,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5.12.</note> ſo by one man entred life. It may be ſaid, <hi>That by one woman ſin entred, and death,</hi> (and that rather then by the man; for,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.14.</note> 
               <hi>Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived, was in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsion.</hi>) But it cannot be ſaid, in that ſenſe, or that manner, that by one woman innocence entred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and life: The Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> had not the ſame intereſt in our ſalvation, as <hi>Eve</hi> had in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; nothing that ſhe did entred into that treaſure, that ranſom that redeemed us. She, more then any other woman, and many other bleſſed women ſince, have done many things for the advancing of the glory of God, and imitation of others; ſo that they are not unfit for ſpiritual converſation; nor for the civil offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of friendſhip neither, where both tentation at home, and ſcandal abroad, may truly be avoided. I know St. <hi>Jerome</hi> in that caſe deſpiſed all ſcandal, and all malicious miſ-interpretations of his purpoſe therein, rather then give over perſwading the Lady <hi>Paula,</hi> to come from <hi>Rome,</hi> to him, and live at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> But, I know not ſo well, that he did well in ſo doing. A fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and aſſiduous converſation with women will hardly be without tentation and ſcandal. St. <hi>Jerome</hi> himſelf apprehended that ſcandal tenderly, and expreſſes it paſſionately; <hi>Sceleratum me putant, &amp; omnibus peccatis obrutum. The world takes me for a vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man,</hi> more (ſceleratum) <hi>for a wicked, a facinorous man, for this, and</hi> obrutum, <hi>ſurrounded, overflowed with all ſins:</hi> Verſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellem, lubricum, mendacem, ſatanae arte decipientem: <hi>They

take me to be a ſlippery fellow, a turn-coat from my profeſſed auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, a Lyar, an Impoſtor, a Deceiver;</hi> yet, though he diſcerned this ſcandal, and this inconvenience in it, he makes ſhift to eaſe himſelf in this, <hi>Nihil aliud mihi objicitur, niſi ſexus meus: They charge me with nothing but my ſex, that I am a man;</hi> Et hoc nunquam objicitur, niſi cum Hieroſolymam <hi>Paula</hi> proficiſcitur, <hi>nor that neither, but becauſe this Lady follows me to</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</p>
            <p>He proceeds farther, <hi>That till he came acquainted in</hi> Paulas <hi>houſe at Rome,</hi> Omnium penè judicio, ſummo ſacerdotio dignus decernebar, <hi>every man thought me fit to be Pope;</hi> every man thought reverently of him, till he uſed her houſe. St. <hi>Jerome</hi> would fain have corrected their miſ-interpretations, and ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſcandal, as we ſee in that vehement expoſtulation, and unlikelihood of an ill love between him and <hi>Paula; Nulla alia me Romae edomare potuit?

He overcame the ſenſe of it, with a <hi>par pari refertur: I,</hi> ſays he, <hi>am even with them:</hi> Invicem inſanire videmur, <hi>they think me mad, and I think them mad:</hi> But this is not always a ſafe, nor a charitable way, when he might ſo eaſily have cured both madneſſes. But he perſeveres in it with that reſolution, <hi>Saluta</hi> Paulam, <hi>velit nolit mundus, in Chriſto meam; Remember me to my</hi> Paula, <hi>let the world ſay what it will, in Chriſt, my</hi> Paula: Thus he proceeds; if excuſably in his own behalf, that is the beſt; certainly not exemplarily, not to be followed by others, in caſes of ſo great ſcandal: For there goes not onely a great deal of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency (which we acknowledge, doubtleſly, to have been between that bleſſed couple) but there muſt go a great deal of neceſſity too, (that is, That <hi>Paula</hi> could not have been reduced by any other means to the ſervice of God, or continued in it, but by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing St. <hi>Jerome</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) to juſtifie ſuch a converſation as became ſo ſcandalous.

            <p>Thus ſome of the Ancients went too far, They would pardon no ſin after Baptiſm; Theſe new Men go not far enough<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They pardon all too eaſily. Old Phyſicians thought all hurts in the heart preſently mortal; Theſe new Phyſitians can pare off ſome of the heart, and give it to Idolatry; for, ſo they ſay, that the worſhip due to God may be given to a creature, ſo it be not <hi>Tanquam Deo,</hi> as that the Creature is thereby profeſſed to be God; and yet, they confeſs that that worſhip which they give to the creature is idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but, not that Idolatry, ſay they, which is forbidden in the commandment, which is, that that Creature, ſo worſhipped with the worſhip due to God, be alſo believed to be God; and ſo, truely I believe it will be hard to finde any Idolatry in the world; That they that worſhip any thing, in repreſentation of God, do believe adviſedly that repreſentation to be <hi>very God.</hi> But the true reaſon why no hurt received in the heart can be healed, is, <hi>quia palpitat,</hi> becauſe it is in perpetual motion. If the heart lay ſtill, as other parts do, ſo that medicinal helps might be applied to it, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by it, there were more hope. Therefore when we lay

ſuch a weight upon the heart, as may ſettle it, fix it, give it a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſedneſs and acquieſcence, though it do receive ſome wounds, though it be touched with ſome tentations, it may be cured. But is there any ſuch weight as ſhould ſo ſettle the heart, the ſoul of Man? This love of Pureneſs is that weight.<note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> 
               <hi>Amor eſt pondus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimae; ſicut gravitas, Corporis;</hi> As the weight of my body makes that ſteady, ſo this love of Pureneſs is the weight and the ballaſt of my ſoul; and this weight ſtays the palpitation, the variation, the devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the heart upon other objects; which variation fruſtrates all endeavors to cure it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>love</hi> of this pureneſs is both the <hi>ballaſt</hi> and the <hi>frait,</hi> to carry thee ſteadily and richly too, through all ſtorms and tempeſts, ſpiritual and temporal in this life, to the everlaſting <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> If you be come to this love, this <hi>love of pureneſs of heart,</hi> never to lock up your door till you have carried out your duſt; never to ſhut your eyes at night, till you have ſwept your conſcience, and caſt your foulneſs into that infinite ſea of the blood of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, which can contract no foulneſs by it; never to open your eyes in the morning, but that you look out to glorifie God in the riſing of the Sun, and in his other creatures, and in the peace and ſafety of your houſe and family, and the health of your children and ſervants; But, eſpecially to look inward, and conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you have not that night mingled <hi>poyſon</hi> with Gods <hi>Phyſick,</hi> whether you have not mingled ſloth and lazineſs in that which God gave you for reſt and refreſhing; whether you have not ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led licentiouſneſs in that which God gave you for a remedy againſt fornication. And then, when you ſhall have found that ſin hath been awake in you, even when your bodies were aſleep, be ſure you caſt not the Spirit of God into a ſleep in you, when your bodies are awake, but that you proceed vigilantly in your ſeveral wayes, with a fore-knowledge, that there is every where <hi>coluber in via,</hi> A Snake in the way; in every way that you can take, in every courſe of life, in every calling, there is ſome of the ſeed of the old Serpent preſents it ſelf.

of that cure, which God, in his Church, in the Abſolution of ſins, and ſeals of Reconciliation, exhibits to it. To recollect and contract that which hath been ſaid, This pureneſs is not a purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pureneſs, to correct and reform thoſe things that appertain not to us; nor it is not ſuch a purified pureneſs as makes us <hi>Canonize</hi> our ſelves, and think others <hi>Reprobates</hi> (for, all this is no pureneſs at all:) neither is it the true pureneſs, if it be not in the heart (for outward good works, not done to good ends, are impure:) nor is this pureneſs of heart acquired by any other means, then by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging the heart in a deteſtation of former habits, and a ſedulous watchfulneſs in preventing future attempts; nor can this pureneſs of heart, though by theſe means attain'd to, be preſerved, but by this noble and incorruptible affection of Love, that puts a true value upon it, and therefore prefers it above all other things. And this was the firſt of the two marks which we found to be upon that perſon that ſhould be capable of the Kings friendſhip, <hi>He that loveth pureneſs of heart.</hi> And the other is, that he have by honeſt induſtry fitted himſelf, in ſome way, to be of uſe to the publike, delivered in that phraſe, <hi>Grace of lips; He that loveth pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart</hi> (There's his honeſty;) <hi>for the Grace of his lips</hi> (There's his ſufficiency;) <hi>The King ſhall be his friend,</hi> There's his reward his preferment.</p>

Publick. I ſpeak not this to your ſelves, you <hi>Senators</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> but as God hath bleſſed you in your ways, and in your Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, ſo put your <hi>children</hi> into ways and courſes too, in which God may bleſs them. The dew of Heaven falls upon them that are abroad; Gods bleſſings fall upon them that travel in the world. The Fathers former labors ſhall not excuſe their Sons future idleneſs; as the Father hath, ſo the Son muſt glorifie God, and contribute to the world, in ſome ſetled courſe. And then, as God hath bleſſed thee in the grace of thy lips, in thy endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors, in thy ſelf, ſo thy ſons ſhall grow up, as the <hi>Son of God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did, <hi>in grace</hi> and <hi>favour of God and man.</hi> As God hath bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thee in the fruit of thy Cattel, ſo he ſhall bleſs thee in the fruit of thy Body; and as he hath bleſſed thee in the <hi>City,</hi> ſo he ſhall bleſs thee in the <hi>Field,</hi> in that Inheritance which thou ſhalt leave to thy Son. Whereas, when children are brought up in ſuch a tenderneſs, and wantonneſs at home, as is too frequent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you in <hi>this City,</hi> they never come to be of uſe to the State, nor their own Eſtates of any longer uſe to them. That Son that comes to ſay. <hi>My Father hath laboured, and therefore I may take mine eaſe,</hi> will come to ſay at laſt, <hi>My Savior hath ſuffered, and therefore I may take my pleaſure; My Savior hath faſted, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I may riot, My Savior hath wept enough, and therefore I may be merry.</hi> But as our Savior requires <hi>Cooperarios,</hi> that we be <hi>fellow-workers</hi> with him to make ſure our ſalvation; ſo if your Sons be not <hi>Cooperarii,</hi> Labourers in ſome courſe of life, to make ſure their Inheritance, though you have been called <hi>wiſe in your gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> that is; rich in your own times, yet you will be called <hi>fools in your generation too;</hi> that is, ignominious and wretched in your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity. In a word, he that will be <hi>nothing</hi> in this world, ſhall be nothing in the next; nor ſhall he have the <hi>Communion of Saints</hi> there, that will not have the Communion of good men here. As much as he can, he fruſtrates Gods Creation; God produced things of nothing, and he endeavours to bring all to nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and he deſpiſes his own immortality and glorification; for ſince he lives the life of a <hi>beaſt,</hi> he ſhews that he could be content to die ſo too, <hi>&amp; accepit animam in vano,</hi> he hath received a ſoul to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>This <hi>grace of lips</hi> then, this ability to do good to the Publick, we are bound to <hi>have;</hi> but we are not commanded to <hi>love</hi> it, as we are the pureneſs of heart; we muſt love to have it, but we muſt not be in love with it when we have it. But ſince the holy Ghoſt hath choſen to expreſs theſe abilities, in this word, <hi>Grace of lips,</hi> that intimates a duty of <hi>utterance,</hi> and declaration of thoſe abilities which he hath. <hi>Habere te agnoſcere, &amp; ex te nihil habere;</hi> To let it appear in the uſe of them, that thou haſt <hi>good parts,</hi> and to confeſs that thou haſt nothing of thine own; <hi>Hoc eſt
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:93368:182"/>
nec ingratum eſſe, nec ſuperbum;</hi> therein thou art neither unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to God, nor proud of thy ſelf. As he that hath no other good parts, but <hi>money;</hi> and locks up that, or employs it ſo, as that his money feeds upon the Commonwealth, and does not feed it, (that it lies gnawing and ſucking blood, by <hi>Uſury,</hi> and does not make blood, by ſtirring and walking in <hi>Merchandize,</hi>) is an unprofitable member in State; ſo he that hath good parts, and ſmothers them, in a retired and uſeleſs life, is inexcuſable in the ſame meaſure. When therefore men retire themſelves into <hi>Cloyſters</hi> and <hi>Monaſteries,</hi> when they will not be content with St. <hi>Pauls</hi> diminution, to be changed from <hi>Saul,</hi> to <hi>Paulus,</hi> (which is <hi>little</hi>) but will go lower then that little, by being called <hi>mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, leſs</hi> then <hi>little,</hi> and lower then that, <hi>minims, leaſt of all;</hi> and yet finde an order leſs then that, as they have done, <hi>nullani, nothing at all, Exore ſuo,</hi> out of their own mouths they ſhall be judged; and that which they have made themſelves here, God ſhal make them in the world to come, <hi>nullanos,</hi> nothing at all. <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum ſepultae diſtatinertiae celata virtus,</hi> It is all one as if he had no grace of lips, if he never have the grace to open his lips; to bury him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alive, is as much wrong to the State, as if he kill himſelf. Every man hath a <hi>Politick life,</hi> as well as a <hi>natural life;</hi> and he may no more take himſelf away from the world, then he may make himſelf away out of the world. For he that dies ſo, by withdrawing himſelf from his calling, from the labours of mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſociety in this life, that man <hi>kills himſelf,</hi> and God calls him not. <hi>Morte morietur,</hi> He ſhall die a double death; an <hi>Allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> death here, in his retiring, from his own hand; and a <hi>real</hi> death from the hand of God hereafter. In this caſe, that <hi>Vae ſoli, Wo be unto him that is alone,</hi> hath the heavieſt weight with it; when a man lives ſo <hi>alone,</hi> as that he reſpects no body but himſelf, his own eaſe, and his own ends. For, to ſum up all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this part, the Subject, as our principal duty is, <hi>Pureneſs of heart towards God,</hi> and to <hi>love</hi> that intirely, earneſtly; ſo the next is the <hi>Grace of lips,</hi> Ability to ſerve the Publick; which though we be bound not to <hi>love</hi> it with a <hi>pride,</hi> we are bound not to <hi>ſmother</hi> with a <hi>retiring.</hi> And then for theſe endowments (for being <hi>Religious,</hi> and <hi>ſerviceable</hi> to the State). <hi>The King ſhall be our friend.</hi> Which is our ſecond general part, to which, in our order propoſed, we are now come.</p>

He called him <hi>Abraham,</hi> a name of dilatation, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem multitudinum,</hi> a Father of multitudes; he made him able to do good to others; for he did not only ſay, <hi>Bleſſed ſhalt thou be,</hi> for that might be, <hi>bleſſed of others, or bleſſed amongſt others;</hi> but it is not <hi>Eris Benedictus,</hi> but <hi>Eris Benedictio,</hi> Thou ſhalt be a Bleſſing,<note place="margin">Gen. 12.2.</note> 
               <hi>a Bleſsing to others.</hi> I will make thee a bleſſed inſtrument of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying my Bleſſings to other men. That's Gods friendſhip, and the higheſt preferment that man is capable of in this life, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend men beyond themſelves, and make them his Inſtruments to others.</p>
            <p>Step we a ſtep lower, from <hi>God</hi> to the <hi>King;</hi> for as Kings have no example but God, ſo according to that example they are reſerv'd, and ſparing in affording that name of <hi>friend</hi> to any. For, as moral men have noted, friendſship implies ſome degrees of equality, which cannot ſtand between <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Subject.</hi> But this is the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to this loving of pureneſs, and this ſeeking the grace of lips; that this is the true and the only way to that friendſhip of the King, which is intended in the word of this Text. The word is <hi>Nagnah;</hi> and <hi>Nagnah</hi> hath ſuch a latitude in the Scriptures, as may well give ſatisfaction to any Subject: For <hi>Nagnah</hi> ſignifies <hi>Amare,</hi> to <hi>love;</hi> and ſo the King ſhall love this man. But we have known caſes in which Kings have been fain to diſguiſe and diſſemble their love, out of a tenderneſs and lothneſs to grieve them whom they have lov'd before; and ſo the King may love this man, and he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the better. Therefore this word <hi>Nagnah,</hi> ſignifies <hi>ſociare,</hi> to draw him nearer, to aſſociate him to him, in Counſels, and other
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:93368:184"/>
ways, and always to afford him eaſie acceſſes unto him; but we have known caſes too, in which Kings, though they have opened one Cabinet, their <hi>Affections,</hi> yet they have ſhut up another, their <hi>Judgements,</hi> and their laſt purpoſes, even from them whom they have drawn near them. For Kings naturally love to be at their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; and it is not only a greatneſs, but an eaſe, to be able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avow an inſtruction, upon the mis-underſtanding of the Miniſter and Inſtrument. Therefore againſt ſuch intricacies and intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, this <hi>Dagnah</hi> ſignifies <hi>Docere,</hi> The King ſhall teach him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him directly, candidly, ingenuouſly, apertly, without any perplexities or reſervations. And who would not purifie his heart, and add grace to his lips, that he might taſte this friendſhip of the King, to be loved by him; and feel the influences of his affection, to be drawn near him; and made partaker of his conſultations; to be taught by him, and carried all the way with clearneſs, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger of miſtaking? And who would not imploy the thoughts of a pure heart, and the praiſes of graceful lips, in thankſgivings to Almighty God, who hath bleſs'd us with ſuch times, as that ſuch Subjects have found ſuch a King!</p>
            <p>Neither is this encouragement to this Pureneſs, and this Grace in our Text, only in the benignity of the King, (which yet were a juſt provocation, that the King would conſider ſuch men before others; for all Kings do not always ſo) but it is in his duty, it is in his office; for, (as our Tranſlators have expreſſed it) we ſee it is not ſaid, The King <hi>will</hi> be; but, The King <hi>ſhall</hi> be his friend; it is not an arbitrary, but a neceſſary thing. God, in whoſe hands the Kings heart is,<note place="margin">Non Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium.</note> and who only can give Law, and Precept to the King, hath ſaid, The King ſhall be his friend. Neither hath God left the King at that largeneſſe, that he ſhall ſeem to be his friend, and do for him as though he were his friend, but yet not be ſo. <hi>Etiam ſimulare Philoſophiam, Philoſophia eſt;</hi> It is a degree of wiſdom to ſeem wiſe.<note place="margin">Veritas Amici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae.</note> To be able to hold the world in opinion that one is great with the King, is a degree of greatneſs. And we have ſome Tales, and Apophthegms to that purpoſe; when men have been ſuiters to the King for that favour, that they might bid him but good morrow in his ear, thereby to put impreſſions in the behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that they had a familiar intereſt in him. But when the grounds of this Royal friendſhip are true and ſolid, Purenſs of heart, and Grace of lips, the friendſhip muſt be ſo too. And then the ground being good, as it is not ſaid, the King ſhall ſeem to be, but he ſhall be; ſo it is not ſaid, the king ſhall have been, but he ſhall be; he ſhall be ſo <hi>ſtill,</hi> he ſhall continue this friendſhip; but yet, but ſo long as this Pureneſs and this Grace continues, which produced this friendſhip in him.</p>

ſhall be <hi>His, His</hi> friend. And to whom hath that <hi>His</hi> relation?

               <hi>Officium ab Efficiendo, &amp; Efficium dicendum,</hi> ſays he. He only is fit for an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that knows how to execute it; he muſt have <hi>pureneſs of heart</hi> for his <hi>end;</hi> for he that propoſes not that end, will make an ill end. And he muſt have this <hi>Grace of lips,</hi> which implies that <hi>civil-wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſdom,</hi> which, (as the Philoſopher notes) <hi>verſatur circa media per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniendi;</hi> He muſt know wherein he may be uſeful and beneficial to others, thankful to God, profitable to others; that's his circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; and then his centre here, is the love of the King. For theſe deſtroy not one another, <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Prudence.</hi> As that love which <hi>Chriſt</hi> bare to St. <hi>John,</hi> who lay in his boſome, (towards whom Chriſt had certainly other <hi>humane</hi> and affectionate reſpects, then he had to the reſt) made him not the leſs fit to be an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> and an <hi>Evangeliſt;</hi> nor the great Office of Apoſtleſhip made him not unfit for that love that Chriſt bare him; ſo both theſe endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Pureneſs of heart,</hi> and <hi>Grace of lips,</hi> are not only compati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but neceſſary to him to whom the King ſhall be a friend. And both theſe doth God require, (if we conſider the force of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal words) when he ſays, <hi>Bring ye men of wiſdom, and known a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Tribes, and I will make them Rulers over you.</hi> For,<note place="margin">Deut 1.13.</note> that addition, <hi>(known among the Tribes)</hi> excludes <hi>reſerv'd</hi> men, <hi>proud</hi> and inacceſſible men; though God do not intend there <hi>popular</hi> men, yet he does intend men acceptable to the people. And when <hi>David</hi> comes to a luſtration, to a ſifting of his Family, as he ſays, <hi>He that walketh in a perfect way, he ſhall ſerve me;</hi> expreſſing in that, this Pureneſs; ſo intending to ſpeak of this Grace of lips,<note place="margin">Pſal. 101.6.</note> which is an ability to be uſeful to others, for which nothing makes a man more unfit then <hi>Pride,</hi> and harſhneſs, and hardneſs of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, he ſcarce knows how to expreſs himſelf and his indignation againſt ſuch a man; <hi>Him</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that hath a proud look, and a high heart, I cannot;</hi> and there he ends abruptly; He does not ſay,<note place="margin">v. 5.</note> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not work upon him, I cannot mend him, I cannot pardon him, I cannot ſuffer him; but only, <hi>I cannot,</hi> and no more; I cannot tell what to do with him, I cannot tell what to ſay of him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I give him over: Him that hath a proud look, and a high heart, I cannot. Whatſoever his grace of lips be, how good ſoever his

            </p>
            <p>To thoſe therefore that have inſinuated themſelves into the friendſhip of the King, without theſe two endowments: If the King hath always Chriſt for his example,<note place="margin">Matth. 22.12.</note> if he ſay to them, <hi>Amice, quomodo intraſti, Friend, how came you in?</hi> If you had not this wedding garment on, or if this wedding garment were not your own, but borrowed by an Hypocritical diſſimulation, <hi>Amice, quomodo intraſti;</hi> though you be never ſo much my friend, in never ſo near place to me, I muſt know how you got in; for, I have but two doors, (indeed, not two <hi>doors,</hi> but a <hi>gate,</hi> and a <hi>wicket;</hi> a greater, and an inferior way.) A <hi>religious heart,</hi> and <hi>uſeful parts;</hi> if you have not theſe, if you fear not God, and, if you ſtudy not, (as I do) the welfare of my people; you are not come in at my <hi>gate,</hi> (that is, <hi>Religion</hi>) nor at my <hi>wicket,</hi> (that is, <hi>the good of my people:</hi>) And therefore, how near ſo ever you be crept, I muſt have a review, an inquiry, to know, <hi>quomodo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſti,</hi> how you came in.</p>
            <p>But for thoſe which have theſe two endowments, <hi>(Religion,</hi> and <hi>care of the publick)</hi> we have the word of the <hi>King of Kings,</hi> of God himſelf, in the mouth of the wiſeſt King, King <hi>Solomon, The King ſhall be his friend:</hi> And the King hath Chriſt himſelf ſtill for his example, <hi>Who loved them whom he loved to the end:</hi> For, as long as the reaſon, upon which he grounds his word, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,<note place="margin">Demeſthenes.</note> 
               <hi>Regis verbum Regi Rex eſt,</hi> the Kings word, the Kings love, the Kings favor, <hi>Regi Rex eſt,</hi> is a King upon the King, and bindes him to his word, as well as his ſubjects are bound to him.</p>
            <p>To recollect and faſten theſe pieces; theſe be the benefits of this pureneſs of heart, and grace of lips, firſt, That the King ſhall take an immediate and perſonal knowledge of him, and not be miſled by falſe characters, or falſe images of him, by any breath that would blaſt him in the Kings ear. And then, tnat he
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:93368:185"/>
ſhall take it to be his Royal Office, and Chriſtian duty to do ſo; that to thoſe men, whom he findes ſo qualified, he ſhall be a friend in all thoſe acceptations of the word in our Text: <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,</hi> he ſhall love them, impart his affections to them; <hi>Sociabit,</hi> he ſhall aſſociate them to him, and impart his conſultations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: And <hi>Sociabit</hi> again, He ſhall go along with them, and accompany their labors, and their ſervices, by the ſeal of his countenance, and ratification: And <hi>Docebit,</hi> He ſhall inſtruct them clearly in his juſt pleaſure, without intangling, or ſnaring them in perplexities, by ambiguous directions. This is the capacity required (to be religious and uſeful;) this is the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aſſured, <hi>The King ſhall be his friend;</hi> and this is the compaſs of our Text.</p>
            <p>Now, Beloved, as we are able to interpret ſome places of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> better then the <hi>Fathers</hi> could do,<note place="margin">Accommodatio ad Diem.</note> becauſe we have ſeen the fulfilling of ſome of the <hi>Prophecies</hi> of that Book, which they did but conjecture upon; ſo we can interpret and apply this Text by way of accommodation the more uſefully, becauſe we have ſeen theſe things performed by thoſe Princes whom God hath ſet over us. We need not that <hi>Edict</hi> of the Senate of <hi>Rome, Ut ſub titulo gratiarum agendarum;</hi> That upon pretence of thanking our Princes, for that which, we ſay, they had done, <hi>Boni principes, quae facerent recognoſcerent,</hi> Good Princes ſhould take knowledge what they were bound to do, though they had not done ſo yet.</p>
            <p>We need not this <hi>Circuit,</hi> nor this <hi>diſguiſe;</hi> for, Gods hand hath been abundant towards us, in raiſing Miniſters of State, ſo qualified, and ſo endowed; and ſuch Princes as have faſtned their friendſhips, and conferred their favors upon ſuch perſons. We celebrate, ſeaſonably, opportunely, the thankful acknowledgment of theſe mercies, this day: This day, which God made for us, according to the pattern of his <hi>firſt days</hi> in the Creation; where, <hi>Veſper &amp; mane dies unus,</hi> the evening firſt, and then the morning made up the day; for, here the ſaddeſt night, and the joyfulleſt morning, that ever the daughters of this Iſland ſaw, made up this day. Conſider the tears of <hi>Richmond</hi> this night, and the joys of <hi>London,</hi> at this place, at this time, in the morning; and we ſhall finde <hi>Prophecy</hi> even in that ſaying of the <hi>Poet, Nocte pluit tota,</hi> ſhowers of rain all night, of weeping for our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign; and we would not be comforted, becauſe ſhe was not:<note place="margin">Matth. 2.18.</note> And yet, <hi>redeunt ſpectacula manè,</hi> the ſame hearts, the ſame eyes, the ſame hands were all directed upon recognitions, and accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of her ſucceſſor, in the morning: And when every one of you in the City were running up and down like Ants with their eggs bigger then themſelves, every man with his bags, to ſeek where to hide them ſafely, Almighty God ſhed down his <hi>Spirit

I add that particular, (from our <hi>Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>) becauſe we ſee, that ſince thoſe men whom our Univerſities had bred, and graduated before they went thither, (of which the number was great, for many years of the Queens time) are worne out amongſt them, and dead; thoſe whom they make up there, whom they have had from their firſt youth there, who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived all their Learning from their beggarly and fragmentary way of Dictates there, and were never grounded in our Schools nor Univerſities, have prov'd but weak maintainers or that cauſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with thoſe men of the firſt times.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Plato</hi> ſays of a particular natural body, he that will cure an ill <hi>Eye,</hi> muſt cure the <hi>Head;</hi> he that will cure the <hi>Head,</hi> muſt cure the <hi>Body;</hi> and he that will cure the <hi>Body,</hi> muſt cure the <hi>Soul;</hi> that is, muſt bring the Minde to a temperature, a moderation, an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity; ſo in Civil Bodies, in States, Head, and Eye, and Body; Prince, and Council, and People, do all receive their health and welfare from the pureneſs of <hi>Religion:</hi> And therefore, as the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all, I choſe to inſiſt upon that Bleſſing, That God hath given us a Religious King, and <hi>Religious out of his Underſtanding.</hi> His other Virtues work upon ſeveral conditions of men; by this Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:93368:187"/>
the whole Body is bleſt. And therefore not only they which have been <hi>ſalted with the ſalt of the Court,</hi> as it is ſaid of the Kings Servants; but all that are <hi>ſalted with the ſalt of the Earth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezra 4.24. Matth. 5.13.

            </p>
            <p>Many other happineſſes are rooted in the love of the Subject; and of his confidence in their love, his very <hi>abſence</hi> from us is an argument to us. His continual abode with us hath been an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his love to us; and this <hi>long Progreſs</hi> of his is an argument of his aſſurance of our loyalty to him. It is an argument alſo of the good habitude and conſtitution to which he hath brought this State, and how little harm they that wiſh ill to it, are able to do,<note place="margin">Mamertinus.

He is not gone from us; for a <hi>Noble</hi> part of this Body, (our Nation) is gone with him, and a <hi>Royal</hi> part of his Body ſtays with us. Neither is the fartheſt place that he goes to, any other then <hi>ours,</hi> now, when, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Orator ſaid; <hi>Nunc demum juvat orbem terrarum ſpectare depictum,</hi>

            <p>To conclude all, and to go the right way from things which we <hi>ſee,</hi> to things which we <hi>ſee not,</hi> by conſideration of the <hi>King,</hi> to the contemplation of <hi>God;</hi> ſince God hath made us his <hi>Tenants</hi> of this World, we are bound, not only to pay our <hi>Rents, (ſpiritual</hi>

            <p>THe firſt Book of the Bible, begins with <hi>the beginning; In principio,</hi> ſays <hi>Moſes,</hi> in <hi>Geneſis; In the beginning God created heaven and earth:</hi> and can there be any thing <hi>prius prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipio,</hi> before the beginning? Before this <hi>beginning,</hi> there is. The laſt Book of the Bible, (in the order as they were written) the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of St. <hi>John,</hi> begins with the ſame word too; <hi>In principio,</hi> ſays St. <hi>John; In the beginning was the Word:</hi> and here, <hi>Noviſsimum pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,</hi> the <hi>laſt</hi> beginning is the <hi>firſt;</hi> St. <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>beginning,</hi> before <hi>Moſes; Moſes</hi> ſpeaking but of the Creature, and St. <hi>John</hi> of the Creator; and of the Creator, before he took that name, before he came to the act of Creation; as, <hi>the Word was with God, and was God</hi> from all Eternity. Our preſent Text is an Epitome of both thoſe beginnings: of the firſt beginning, the Creation, when <hi>God commanded light to ſhine out of darkneſs;</hi> and of the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, which is indeed the firſt, of Him, in whoſe face we ſhall have <hi>the knowledge of the glory of God, Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt Book of the Bible, is a Revelation, and ſo is the laſt, in the order as they ſtand, a Revelation too. To declare a producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all things out of nothing, (which is <hi>Moſes</hi> his work;) that when I do not know, and care not whether I know or no, what ſo
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:93368:189"/>
contemptible a Creature as an Ant is made of, but yet would fain know what ſo vaſt, and ſo conſiderable a thing as an Elephant is made of; I care not for a muſtard ſeed, but I would fain know what a Cedar is made of; I can leave out the conſideration of the whole Earth, but would be glad to know what the Heavens, and the glorious bodies in the Heavens, Sun, Moon and Stars are made of; I ſhall have but one anſwer from <hi>Moſes</hi> for all, that all my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephants, and Cedars, and the Heavens that I conſider, were made of nothing; that a Cloud is as nobly born, as the Sun in the Heavens; and a begger, as nobly, as the King upon Earth; if we conſider the great Grand-father of them all, to be nothing: to produce light of darkneſs thus, is a Revelation, a Manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that, which, till then, was not: this <hi>Moſes</hi> does. St. <hi>John</hi>'s is a Revelation too: a Manifeſtation of that ſtate, which ſhall be, and be for ever, after all thoſe which were produced of nothing, ſhall be return'd and reſſolv'd to nothing again; the glorious ſtate of the everlaſting <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Kingdom of Heaven. Now this Text is a Revelation of both theſe Revelations: the firſt ſtate, that which <hi>Moſes</hi> reveals, was too dark for man to ſee; for it was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: The other, that which St. <hi>John</hi> reveals, is too bright, too dazling for man to look upon; for it is no one limited, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Object, but all at once, glory, and the ſeat and fountain of all glory, the face of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>The Holy Ghoſt hath ſhewed us both theſe, ſeverally in <hi>Moſes,</hi> and in St. <hi>John,</hi> and both together in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in this Text: where, as the Sun ſtands in the midſt of the Heavens, and ſhews us both the Creatures that are below it, upon Earth, and the Creatures that are above it, the Stars in Heaven; ſo St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as he is made an Apoſtle of the Gentiles, ſtands in the midſt of this Text, <hi>(God hath ſhin'd in our hearts:)</hi> Ours, as we are Apoſtolical Miniſters of the Goſpel; and he ſhows us the greatneſs of God, in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which was before, when <hi>God commanded light out of darkneſs;</hi> and the goodneſs of God which ſhall be hereafter, when he ſhall give us <hi>the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that this Text, giving light, by which we ſee, light comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by God out of darkneſs; and the Object which we are to ſee, <hi>the knowledge of the glory of God;</hi> and this Object being brought within a convenient diſtance to be ſeen <hi>in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And a fit and well-diſpoſed <hi>Medium</hi> being illumin'd, through which we may ſee it, God having ſhin'd in our hearts, eſtabliſhed a Miniſtry of the Goſpel: for that purpoſe, if you bring but eyes, to that which this Text brings, Light, and Object, and Diſtance, and Means, then, as St. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaid of the Book of Pſalms, upon an impoſſible ſuppoſition, If all the other Books of Scripture could periſh, there were enough in that one, for the catechiſing of all
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:93368:189"/>
that did believe, and for the convincing of all that did not: ſo if all the other Writings of St. <hi>Paul</hi> could periſh, this Text were enough to carry us through the body of Divinity, from the Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the world, in the Creation, when God commanded light out of darkneſs, to the Grave; and beyond the Grave of the world, to the laſt Diſſolution; and beyond it, when we ſhall have fully, <hi>the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Now, whilſt I am to ſpeak of all this, this, which is <hi>Omne ſcibile,</hi> all, and more then can fall within the comprehenſion of a natural man; for it is the beginning of this world, and it is the way to the next, and it is the next world it ſelf, I comfort my ſelf at my firſt ſetting out, with that of St. <hi>Gregory, Purgatas aures, &amp; hominum gratiam nanciſci, nonne Dei donum est?</hi> I take it for one of Gods great bleſſings to me, if he have given me now an Auditory, <hi>Purgatae au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> of ſuch ſpiritual and circumciſed Ears, as come not to hear that Wiſdom of Words, which may make the Croſs of Chriſt of none effect; much leſs ſuch itching Ears, as come to hear po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular and ſeditious Calumnies and Scandals, and Reproaches, caſt upon the preſent State and Government. For, a man may make a Sermon, a Satyr; he may make a Prayer, a Libel, if upon co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of preaching, or praying, againſt toleration of Religion, or perſecution for Religion, he would inſinuate, that any ſuch tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations are prepared for us, or ſuch perſecutions threatned againſt us. But if for ſpeaking the myſteries of your ſalvation, plainly, ſincerely, inelegantly, inartificially; for the Gold, and not for the Faſhion; for the Matter, and not for the Form, <hi>Nanciſcor populi gratiam,</hi> my ſervice may be acceptable to Gods people, and avai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable to their Edification; <hi>Nonne Dei donum,</hi> ſhall not I call this a great Bleſſing of God? Beloved, in him, I muſt; I do. And therefore, becauſe I preſume I ſpeak to ſuch, I take to my ſelf, that which follows there, in the ſame Father, that he that ſpeaks to ſuch a people, does not his duty, if he conſider not deliberately, <hi>Quibus, Quando, Quantum loquatur;</hi> both to whom, and at what time, and how much he is to ſpeak. I conſider the perſons; and I conſider that the greateſt part, by much, are perſons born ſince the Reformation of Religion, ſince the death of Idolatry in this Land; and therefore not naturaliz'd by Converſion, by Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantation from another Religion to this, but born the natural children of this Church; and therefore, to ſuch perſons, I need not lay hold upon any points of controverted Doctrine. I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der alſo <hi>Quando,</hi> the time; and I conſider, that it is now, in theſe days of <hi>Easter,</hi> when the greateſt part of this Auditory, have, or will renew their Hands to Chriſt Jeſus in the Sacrament of his Body, and his Blood; that they will rather looſe theirs, then lack his: and therefore towards perſons, who have teſtified that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in that ſeal, I need not depart into any vehement, or
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:93368:190"/>
paſſionate Exhortations to conſtancy and perſeverance, as though there were occaſion to doubt it. And I conſider laſtly, <hi>Quantum,</hi> how much is neceſſary to be ſpoken to ſuch a people, ſo diſpoſed; and therefore, farther then the cuſtom, and ſolemnity of this day, and place, lays an Obligation upon me, I will not extend my ſelf to an unneceſſary length; eſpecially, becauſe that which ſhall be ſaid by me, and by my Brethren which come after, and were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to come before me, in this place, is to be ſaid to you again, by another, who alone, takes as much pains, as all we, and all you too: Hears all, with as much patience as all you; and is to ſpeak of all, with as much, and more labour, then all we. Much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for your eaſe, ſomewhat for his, a little for mine own, with ſuch ſuccinctneſs and brevity, as may conſiſt with clearneſs, and perſpicuity, in ſuch manner, and method, as may beſt enlighten your underſtandings, and leaſt encumber your memories, I ſhall open unto you that light, which God commanded out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that light by which <hi>he hath ſhin'd in our hearts;</hi> and this light, by which we ſhall have <hi>the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Christ Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Diviſio.</note>Our parts therefore in theſe words, muſt neceſſarily be three; three Lights. The firſt, ſhows us our Creation; the ſecond, our Vocation; the third, our Glorification. In the firſt, We, who were but, (but what?) but nothing, were made Creatures: In the ſecond, we, who were but Gentiles, were made Chriſtians: In the third, we, who were but men, ſhall be made ſaints. In the firſt, God took us, when there was no world: In the ſecond, God ſuſtains us, in an ill world: In the third, God ſhall crown us, in a glorious and joyful world. In the firſt, God made us; in the ſecond, God mends us; in the third, God ſhall perfect us. Firſt, <hi>God commanded light out of darkneſs,</hi> that man might ſee the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; then <hi>he ſhin'd in our hearts,</hi> that man might ſee himſelf; at laſt, he ſhall ſhine ſo <hi>in the face of Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> that man may ſee God, and live; and live as long, as that God of light and life ſhall live himſelf. Every one of theſe Parts, will have divers Branches; and it is time to enter into them. In the firſt, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe this Text does not purpoſely and primarily deliver the Doctrine of the Creation, not prove it, not preſs it, not enforce it; but rather ſuppoſe it, and then propoſe it by way of Example and Compariſon; (for when the Apoſtles ſays, <hi>God, who comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded light out of darkneſs, hath ſhin'd in our hearts,</hi> he intimates there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, theſe two Propoſitions: firſt, that the ſame God that does the one, does the other too; God perfects his works; and then this Propoſition alſo, As God hath done the one, he hath done the other: God himſelf works by Patterns, by Examples.) Theſe two Propoſitions ſhall therefore be our two firſt Branches in this firſt Part. Firſt, <hi>Idem Deus,</hi> the ſame God goes through his works; and
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:93368:190"/>
therefore let us never fear that God will be weary: and then <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut Deus,</hi> as God hath done, he will do again; he works by pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, and ſo muſt we: and then from theſe two, we ſhall deſcend to our third Propoſition, <hi>Quid Deus,</hi> what God is ſaid to have done here; and it is, that he <hi>commanded light out of darkneſs.</hi> In theſe three, we ſhall determine this Part; and for the Branches of the other two Parts, our Vocation, and our Glorification, it will be a leſs burden to your memories, to open them then, when we come to handle the Parts themſelves, then altogether now. Now we ſhall proceed in the Branches of the firſt Part.<note place="margin">Part 1. <hi>Memb.</hi> 1. <hi>Idem Deus.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>In this, our firſt Conſideration is, <hi>Idem Deus,</hi> the ſame our God goes through all. Thoſe divers Hereticks who thought there were two Gods, (for <hi>Cordon</hi> thought ſo, and <hi>Marcion</hi> thought ſo too; the <hi>Gnostiques</hi> thought ſo, and the <hi>Maniches</hi> thought ſo too) though they differ'd in their miſtakings, (for errour is always manifold, and multiform) yet all their errours were upon this ground, this root, They could nor comprehend that the ſame God ſhould be the God of Juſtice, and the God of Mercy too; a God that had an earneſtneſs to puniſh ſin, and an eaſineſs to pardon ſin too. <hi>Cordon,</hi> who was firſt, though he made two Gods, yet he uſed them both reaſonable well; for with him, <hi>Alter Bonus, Alter Juſtus;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iren.</hi> 1.28.29.</note> one of his Gods is perfectly good, merciful; and the other, though he be not ſo very good, yet he is juſt. <hi>Marcion,</hi> who came after, ſays worſe; becauſe he could not diſcern the good purpoſes of God in inflicting Judgements, nor the good uſe which good men make of his Corrections; but thought all acts of his Juſtice to be calamitous and intolerable, and naturally evil: therefore with him, <hi>Alter Bonus, Alter Malus;</hi> he that is the merciful God, is his good God; and he that is ſo juſt, but juſt, is an ill God. Hence they came to call the God of the New Teſtament, a good God, becauſe there was <hi>Copioſa Redemptio,</hi> plentiful Redemption in the Goſpel: and the God of the Old Teſtament, <hi>Malum Deum,</hi> an ill God, becauſe they thought all penalties of the Law, evil. They came lower; to call that God, which created the Upper Region of man, the Brain, and the Heart, (the preſence and privy Chamber of Reaſon, and conſequently of Religion too) a good God, becauſe good things are enacted there; and that God that created the Lower Region of man, the ſeat and ſcene of Carnal Deſires, and inordinate Affections, an ill God, becauſe ill actions are perpetrated there. But <hi>Idem Deus,</hi> the ſame <hi>God that comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded light out of darkneſs, hath ſhin'd in our hearts:</hi> The God of the Law, and the God of the Goſpel too; The God of the Brain, and the God of the Belly too; The God of Mercy, and the God of Juſtice too, is all one God.</p>
            <p>In all the Scriptures, you ſhall ſcarce find ſuch a Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods Indignation, ſuch a ſevere Execution, as that upon
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:93368:191"/>
the Syrians; when, after the ſlaughter of one hundred thouſand foot in the field in one day, the walls of the City, into which they fled, fell, and ſlew twenty ſeven thouſand more. The Armies of the Iſraelites were that day, but as <hi>little flocks of kids,</hi> ſays the Text there; and yet thoſe few, ſlew one hundred thouſand. The Walls of <hi>Aphak</hi> promiſed ſuccour; and yet they fell, and ſlew twenty ſeven thouſand. Now from whence proceeded Gods ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement anger in this defeat? The Prophet tells the King the cauſe; <hi>Becauſe the Syrians have ſaid, The Lord is God of the hills, but he is not God of the vallies.</hi> The Iſraelites had beaten them upon the Hills, and they could not attribute this to their Forces, for they were very ſmall; they muſt neceſſarily aſcribe it to their God; but they thought they might find a way to be too hard for their God: and therefore, ſince he was a God of the <hi>mountains,</hi> they would fight with him in the <hi>vallies.</hi> But the God of Iſrael is <hi>Idem Deus,</hi> one and the ſame God. He is <hi>Jugatinus</hi> and <hi>Vallonia</hi> both, as St. <hi>Aug.</hi> ſpeaks out of the Roman Authors: he is God of the mountains, he can exalt; and he is God of the Vallies, he can throw down. Our Age hath produced ſuch Syrians, too; Men, who, after God hath declared himſelf againſt them many ways, have yet thought they might get an advantage upon him ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way. They begun in Rebellions; animated perſons of great blood, and great place, to rebels their Rebellions God fruſtrated. Then they came to ſay, (to ſay in actions) Their God is God of Rebellions, a God that reſiſts Rebellions; but he is no God of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications: then they excommunicated us. But our God caſt thoſe thunder-bolts, thoſe <hi>Bruta fulmina,</hi> into the Sea, no man took fire at them. Then they ſaid, He is a God of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications, he will not ſuffer an Excommunication ſtollen out in his Name, againſt his Children, to do any harm; but he is no God of Invaſion, let's try him there: Then they procured Invaſion; and there the God of Iſrael ſhew'd himſelf the Lord of Hoſts, and ſcattered them there. Then they ſaid, he is the God of Invaſions, annihilates them; but he is not the God of Supplantations; ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their God will not pry into a Cellar, he will not peep into a vault; he is the God of water, but he is not the God of fire; let's try him in that Element; and in that Element, they ſaw one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother juſtly eviſcorated, and their bowels burnt. All this they have ſaid, ſo as we have heard them; for they have ſaid it in loud Actions, and ſtill they ſay ſomething in corners, which we do not hear. Either he is not a God of Equivocations, and therefore let us be lying ſpirits in the mouthes of ſome of his Prophets, draw ſome men that are in great Opinion of Learning, to our ſide, or at leaſt draw the people into an Opinion that we have drawn them; or elſe, he is not the God of jealouſie and ſuſpition, and therefore let us ſupple and ſlumber him with ſecurity, and

pretences and diſguiſes. But he is <hi>Idem Deus;</hi> that God who hath begun, and proceeded, will perſevere in mercy towards us. Our God is not out of breath, becauſe he hath blown one tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, and ſwallowed a Navy: Our God hath not burnt out his eyes, becauſe he hath looked upon a Train of Powder: In the the light of Heaven, and in the darkneſs of hell, he ſees alike; he ſees not onely all Machinations of hands, when things come to action; but all Imaginations of hearts, when they are in their firſt Conſultations: paſt, and preſent, and future, diſtinguiſh not his <hi>Quando;</hi> all is one time to him: Mountains and Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, Sea and Land, diſtinguiſh not his <hi>Ubi;</hi> all is one place to him: <hi>When I begin,</hi> ſays God to <hi>Eli, I will make an end;</hi> not onely that all Gods purpoſes ſhall have their certain end, but that even then, when he begins, he makes an end: from the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, imprints an infallible aſſurance, that whom he loves, he loves to the end: as a Circle is printed all at once, ſo his beginning and ending is all one.</p>
            <p>Make thou alſo the ſame interpretation of this <hi>Idem Deus,</hi> in all the Viciſſitudes and Changes of this World. Hath God brought thee from an Expoſititious Child laid out in the ſtreets, of uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain name, of unknown Parents, to become the firſt foundation-ſtone of a great family, and to enoble a poſterity? Hath God brought thee from a Carriers Pack, upon which thou cameſt up, to thy change of Foot-Cloathes, and Coaches? Hath God brought thee from one of theſe Blew-Coats, to one of thoſe Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let Gowns? Attribute not this to thine own Induſtry, nor to thine own Frugality; (for, Induſtry is but Fortunes right hand, and Frugality her left;) but come to <hi>Davids</hi> Acclamation, <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Fecit, It is the Lords doing:</hi> That takes away the impoſſibility:<note place="margin">Pſal. 118.22.</note> If the Lord will do it, it may be, it muſt be done; but yet even that takes not away the wonder; for, as it follows there, <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus fecit, &amp; est Mirabile,</hi> though the Lord have done it, <hi>it is wonderful in our eyes,</hi> to ſee whom, and from whence, and whither, and how God does raiſe, and exalt ſome men. And then if God be pleas'd to make thee a Roll written on both ſides, a Hiſtory of Adverſity, as well as of Proſperity: if when he hath fill'd his Tables, with the ſtory of <hi>Mardoche,</hi> a man ſtrangely raiſed, he takes his Spunge, and wipes out all that, and writes down in thee, the ſtory of <hi>Job,</hi> a man ſtrangely ruin'd, all this is <hi>Idem Deus,</hi> ſtill the ſame God, and the ſame purpoſe in that God, ſtill to bring thee nearer to him, though by a lower way. If then thou abound,<note place="margin">Luk. 12.19.</note> come not to ſay with the over-ſecure man, <hi>Soul, thou hast much goods laid up, for many years, take thine eaſe, eat, drink and be merry:</hi> and if thou want, come not to that impatience of that Prophet, <hi>Satis eſt, Lord, this is enough, now take away my life:</hi> Nay, though the Lord lead thee into tentation, and do not deliver thee from

               <hi>Egypt,</hi> but let thee fall into a ſin, though he let thee fall ſo far, as to doubt of his mercy for that ſin, yet <hi>Idem Deus,</hi> all this while, all this is the ſame God; and even that voice, though it have an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of deſpair in it, is the voice of God; and though it be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the mouth of the Devil, it is God that ſpeakes it; for even then, when the Devil poſſeſſes man, God poſſeſſes the Devil. God can make his profit, and thine, of thy ſin: he can make the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of a ſin committed, the occaſion of thy repentance, and his mercy:<note place="margin">Amos 3.6.</note> for, <hi>Shall there be evil in a City, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> God is no diſpoſer to ſin, but he is the diſpoſer of ſin: God is not Lord of ſin, as Author of ſin; but he is the Lord of ſin, as Steward of it: and he diſpenſes not onely for our ſins, but the ſins themſelves. God imprints not that obliquity, infuſes not that venome that is in our ſinful Actions, but God can extract good out of bad, and Cordials out of Poyſon. Be not thou therefore too nimble a Sophiſter, nor too preſſing an Advocate againſt thine own ſoul: conclude not too ſoon, that God hath forſaken thee, becauſe he hath let thee fall, and let thee lie ſome time, in ſome ſin: you know who did ſo, and yet was <hi>a man according to Gods own heart;</hi> for God hath ſet his heart upon that way, to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie himſelf out of <hi>Davids</hi> repentance, rather then out of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence. In the Hills, and in the Vallies too; in ſpiritual, as well as in temporal proſperity and adverſity too; in the Old, and in the New Teſtament; in the ways of mercy, and of juſtice too, thou maiſt find the ſame God, who is in every change <hi>Idem Deus; God,</hi> that is, the ſame God, <hi>who commanded light out of darkneſs, hath ſhin'd in our hearts:</hi> And ſo we have done with the firſt Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>

               <note place="margin">Sicut Deus.</note>The next is, <hi>Sicut Deus;</hi> As God hath done the one, ſo he hath the other. God brings himſelf into compariſon with himſelf: Our unworthineſs changes not his nature: His <hi>mercy is new every morning;</hi> and, <hi>his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> One generation is a precedent to another, and <hi>God</hi> is his own Example; whatſoever he hath done for us, he is ready to do again. When he had once written the Law in ſtone-tables, for the direction of his people, and that <hi>Moſes</hi> in an over-vehement zeal and diſtemper, had broke thoſe Tables, <hi>God</hi> turn'd to his precedent, remembred what he had done, and does ſo again; he writes that Law again in new Tables. When <hi>God</hi> had given us the light of the Reformation for a few years of a young King, and that after him, in the time of a pious truly, but credulous Princeſs, a Cloud of blood over-ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed us in a heavy perſecution, yet <hi>God</hi> turn'd to his precedent, to the example of his former mercy, and in mercy re-eſtabliſhed that light, which ſhines yet amongſt us; and (if the ſins of the people extinguiſh it not) ſhall ſhine as long as the Sun and Moon ſhall ſhine above. The Lords hand is not ſhortned, nor weakned

in the ways of juſtice; and his juſtice hath a <hi>Sicut,</hi> a precedent, an Example too.

There is <hi>Sicut Midian;</hi> God can do unto the men of theſe times, as he did unto the Midianites, as to <hi>Siſera,</hi> as to <hi>Jabin,</hi> which periſhed, and became as the Dung of the earth. He can make their Nobles <hi>Sicut Oreb, Sicut Zeeb,</hi> like unto <hi>Oreb,</hi> like unto <hi>Zeeb,</hi> and all their Princes <hi>Sicut Zebah, Sicut Salmana.</hi> There are precedents of his juſtice too. But yet in the greateſt act of his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice that ever he did, which was the general drowning of the whole world, though that hiſtory remain as an everlaſting Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his power, and of his juſtice, yet he would not have it remain as a precedent; but he records that, with that proteſtation, <hi>I will no more curſe the earth, nor ſmite any more, every living thing, as I have done:</hi> though I have ſhow'd that I can do it, and have done it, I will do it no more. God forbears, and wayes his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in matter of juſtice; but God never ſhew'd any mercy, but he deſires that that mercy may be recorded, and produc'd, and pleaded to our Conſcience, to the whole Congregation, to God himſelf, as a leading and a binding caſe, as he <hi>commanded light out of darkneſs,</hi> ſo <hi>he hath ſhin'd in our hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God proceeds by example, by pattern: Even in this firſt great act preſented in our Text, in the Creation he did ſo. God had no external pattern in the Creation, for there was nothing extant; but God had from all Eternity an internal pattern, an <hi>Idaea,</hi> a pre-conception, a form in himſelf, according to which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd every Creature. And when God himſelf proceeds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pre-conceptions, pre-meditations, ſhall we adventure to do, or to ſay any thing in his ſervice unpremeditately, extemporally? It is not Gods way. Now, it is a penurious thing, to have but one Candle in a room: it is too dim a light to work by, to live by, to have but Rule and Precept alone; Rule and Example together, direct us fully. Who ſhall be our Example?<note place="margin">Hierom.</note>

When was there ſuch a Conception, of the Holy Ghoſt? ſuch a birth, of a Virgin? ſuch a pregnancy to diſpute ſo, ſo young, with ſuch men?

That little Philoſopher <hi>Epictetus,</hi> could give us that Rule; Whenſoever thou enter priſeſt, any action, ſays he, conſider what <hi>Socrates,</hi> what <hi>Plato,</hi> (that is, what a wiſe and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man) would have done in that caſe, and do thou ſo.

And when you have made up your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit that way, rectified your ſelf by that courſe, then, as your Sons write by Copies, and your Daughters work by Samplars, be eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Father a Copy to his Son, every Mother a Samplar to her Daughter, and every houſe will be an Univerſity. O in how bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a nearneſs to their Direction, is that Child, and that Servant, and that Pariſhioner, who, when they ſhall ſay to Almighty God, by way of Prayer, What ſhall I do, to get eternal life? ſhall hear God anſwer to them by his Spirit, Do but as thou ſeeſt thy Father do, do as thou ſeeſt thy Maſter do, do as thou ſeeſt thy Paſtor do! To become a precedent, govern thy ſelf by precedent firſt; which is all the Doctrine that I intended to deduce out of this ſecond Propoſition, <hi>Sicut Deus,</hi> As God commanded light out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo he hath ſhin'd in our hearts: God did as he had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: and ſo we paſs from the <hi>Idem Deus,</hi> and the <hi>Sicut Deus,</hi> to the <hi>Quid Deus,</hi> What that is which God hath done here, <hi>He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded light out of darkneſs.</hi>

of all out of nothing. For, for the repairing of the world after the Flood, compared to the Creation, it was eight to nothing; eight perſons to begin a world upon, then; but in the Creation, none. And for the glory which we receive in the next world, it is (in ſome ſort) as the ſtamping of a print upon a Coyn; the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal is there already, a body and a ſoul to receive glory: but at the Creation, there was no ſoul to receive glory, no body to receive a ſoul, no ſtuff, no matter, to make a body of. The leſs any thing is, the leſs we know it: how inviſible, how intelligible a thing then, is this <hi>Nothing!</hi> We ſay in the School, <hi>Deus cognoſcibilior Angelis,</hi> We have better means to know the nature of God, then of Angels, becauſe God hath appeared and manifeſted himſelf more in actions, then Angels have done: we know what they are, by knowing what they have done; and it is very little that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to us what Angels have done: what then is there that can bring this Nothing to our underſtanding? what hath that done? A Leviathan, a Whale, from a grain of Spawn; an Oke from a buried Akehorn, is a great; but a great world from nothing, is a ſtrange improvement. We wonder to ſee a man riſe from no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to a great Eſtate; but that Nothing is but nothing in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon; but abſolutely nothing, meerly nothing, is more incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible then any thing, then all things together. It is a ſtate (if a man may call it a ſtate) that the Devil himſelf in the midſt of his torments, cannot wiſh. No man can, the Devil himſelf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, adviſedly, deliberately, wiſh himſelf to be nothing. It is truely and ſafely ſaid in the School, That whatſoever can be the ſubject of a wiſh, if I can deſire it, wiſh it, it muſt neceſſarily be better (at leaſt in my opinion) then that which I have; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is better, is not nothing; whithout doubt it muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily produce more thankfulneſs in me, towards God, that I am a Chriſtian; but certainly more wonder that I am a Creature: it is vehemently ſpoken, but yet needs no excuſe, which <hi>Justin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſays, <hi>Ne ipſi quidem Domino fidem haberem,</hi> &amp;c. I ſhould ſcarce believe God himſelf, if he ſhould tell me, that any but himſelf cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated this world of nothing; ſo infallible, and ſo inſeparable a work, and ſo diſtinctive a Character is it of the Godhead, to produce any thing from nothing; and that God did when he commanded light out of darkneſs.</p>

In this part,<note place="margin">Diviſio.</note> we ſhall have two Branches; a poſitive, and a comparative conſideration of the words: Firſt, the matter it ſelf, what this ſhining is; and it is the converſion of Man to God, by the miniſtry of the Goſpel; and ſecondly, how this manner of expreſſing it, anſwers the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>As God commanded light out of darkneſs,</hi> ſo he hath <hi>ſhin'd in our hearts.</hi> And in the firſt, the poſitive, we ſhall paſs by theſe few and ſhort ſteps: firſt, Gods action, <hi>Illuxit,</hi> he ſhine; it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Manifeſtation: And then, the time, when this day breaks, when this Sun riſes. <hi>Illuxit,</hi> he hath ſhin'd, he hath done enough already. Thirdly, the place, the ſphere in which he ſhines, the Orb which he hath illumin'd, <hi>in Cordibus:</hi> if he ſhine, he ſhines in the heart. And laſtly, the perſons, upon whom he caſts his beams,

               <hi>in Cordibus noſtris,</hi> in our hearts. And having paſt theſe four in the poſitive part, we ſhall deſcend to the comparative; as <hi>God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded light out of darkneſs,</hi> ſo he hath <hi>ſhin'd in our hearts.</hi>

And therefore the Philoſopher draws man into too narrow a table, when he ſays he is <hi>Microcoſmos,</hi> an Abridgement of the world in little: <hi>Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen</hi> gives him but his due, when he calls him <hi>Mundum Magnum,</hi> a world to which all the reſt of the world is but ſubordinate: For all the world beſides, is but Gods Foot-ſtool; Man ſits down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his right hand: and howſoever God be in all the world, yet how did God dwell in man, in the aſſumption of that nature? and what care did GOD take of that dwelling, that when that houſe was demoliſhed, would yet dwell in the ruines thereof? for the Godhead did not depart from the dead body of Chriſt Jeſus in the Grave. And then how much more gloriouſly then before, did he re-edifie that houſe, in raiſing it again to Glory? Man therefore is <hi>Cura Divini ingenii,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tertul.</note> a creature upon whom, not onely the greatneſs, and the goodneſs, but even the ſtudy and diligence of God is employed. And being thus a greater world then the other, he muſt be greater in all his parts, and ſo in his lights; and ſo he is: for, inſtead of this light, which the world had at firſt, Man hath a nobler light, an immortal, a diſcerning ſoul, the light of reaſon. Inſtead of the many ſtars, which this world hath, man hath had the light of the Law, and the ſucceſſion of the Prophets: And inſtead of that Sun, which this world had, a Son from God; man hath had the Son of God; God hath ſpoken to us by his Son; God hath ſhin'd upon us in his Son. The whole work of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, in the Converſion of man, is many times expreſſed by this act of ſhining;<note place="margin">Act. 2.2.</note> an effectual, a powerful ſhining. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the Holy Ghoſt into the Apoſtles at Pentecoſt, was with fire: The light which ſhin'd upon St. <hi>Paul,</hi> going to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> ſtruck him to the ground.<note place="margin">Act, 9.4.</note> And in both thoſe caſes, there were tongues too. The Apoſtles fire, was fiery tongues, and St. <hi>Pauls</hi> light, was accompanied with a voice; for then does God truely ſhine to us, when he appears to our eyes and to our ears, when by viſible and audible means, by Sacraments which we ſee, and by the Word which we he hear, he conveys himſelf unto us. In <hi>Pauls</hi> caſe, there were ſome that ſaw the light, but heard not the voice: God hath joyn'd them, ſeperate them not: Upon him that will
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:93368:195"/>
come to hear, and will not come to ſee; will come to the <hi>Sermon,</hi> but not to the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> or that will come to ſee, but will not come to hear; will keep his ſolemn, and feſtival, and Anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary times of receiving the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> but never care for being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the duties appertaining to that high Myſtery, God hath not ſhin'd. They are a powerful thunder, and lightning, that go together: Preaching is the thunder, that clears the air, diſperſes all clouds of ignorance; and then the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is the lightning, the glorious light, and preſence of Chriſt Jeſus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And in the having and loving of theſe, the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> the outward means of ſalvation, ordained by God in his Church, conſiſts this Irradiation, this Cotuſcation, this ſhining. And we have done with that.</p>
            <p>The next is the time, <hi>Illuxit,</hi> he hath ſhin'd already;<note place="margin">Illuxit.</note> and <hi>Illuxit Mundo,</hi> he hath ſhin'd; that is, manifeſted himſelf ſufficiently to the whole world. <hi>Illuxit Nobis,</hi> he hath done it fully to this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and <hi>Illuxit Vobis,</hi> he hath ſhin'd ſufficiently upon every one of you. Firſt, upon the whole world; for, though at firſt he ſhin'd onely upon the Jews, and left all the world beſide in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of death; and even to the Jews themſelves, he ſhin'd but <hi>as a light in a dark place;</hi> the Temple it ſelf was but a dark room in reſpect of the Chriſtian Church; yet,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.19.</note> as ſoon as Chriſt had eſtabliſh'd that, illumin'd that, inanimated that, given it breath in his Word, the written Scriptures, and given it motion, and action in the preaching of that Word. and Adminiſtration of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> when this was done, immediately there was <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridies,</hi> a full noon; the light was at the higheſt, the Sun was at the Tropique, it could go no further; no fundamental thing can be added by man to this light by which the <hi>Son</hi> of God hath ſhin'd in his Church. To ſet up Candles to Images, is a weakneſs in them that do it; but to ſet up Candles to God, is a preſumption; that God cannot or hath not ſhin'd out ſufficiently upon his Church, in his Inſtitutions, but that they muſt ſupply him with the traditions and additions of men. <hi>Lex Lux,</hi> ſays <hi>David, The Law of God,</hi> the Scripture, <hi>is a light,</hi> it is the light, it is all light; and therefore they who would take away this light, not ſuffer men to read the Scriptures; or if they will not ſnuff this light, not mend the Barbariſms, the Errours, the Contradictions which are in their Tranſlation, and let it ſhine according to the Original Truth, this is a ſhutting of their eyes againſt this <hi>Illuxit:</hi> For, God hath ſhow'd enough, and ſaid enough, and done enough, and ſuffer'd enough, for the ſalvation of his Church; he hath ſhin'd out upon all, and needs no ſupply of leſſer lights.</p>
            <p>So he hath ſhin'd upon all; and <hi>Illuxit Nobis,</hi> he hath ſhin'd abundantly upon this Nation. He ſhin'd upon us betimes; this day ſprung, this Sun roſe in the Eaſt; in the Eaſt, Chriſt liv'd
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:93368:196"/>
and preach'd in perſon; but in his Beams, his Meſſengers, he ſhin'd quickly into the Weſt too. And when he did ſo, he did not ſo ſhine upon the Weſt, upon <hi>Rome,</hi> as that that light was caſt upon us, as by reflection from a glaſs, from the walls of <hi>Rome:</hi> but we had it, as they had it, by perſons ordained by God, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey it over the world. I diſpute not too earneſtly, I determine not too vehemently any matter of fact in this point. I confeſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly, we had many Aſſiſtances from <hi>Rome;</hi> but truely, ſhe hath been even with us ſince: and, <hi>Computatis Computandis,</hi> I think ſhe may be content to give us an Acquittance. God ſhin'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Iſland early; early in the plantation of the Goſpel, (for we had not our ſeed-Corn from <hi>Rome,</hi> howſoever we may have had ſome waterings from thence) and early in the Reformation of the Church: for we had not the model of any other Forreign Church for our pattern; we ſtript not the Church into a nakedneſs, nor into rags; we deveſted her not of her poſſeſſions, nor of her Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, but received ſuch a Reformation at home, by their hands whom God enlightned, as left her neither in a Dropſie, nor in a Conſumption; neither in a ſuperfluous and cumberſome fatneſs, nor in an uncomely and faint leanneſs and attenuation: Early in the Plantation, early in the Reformation, <hi>Illuxit Nobis,</hi> and we have light enough, without either ſeeing other light from <hi>Rome,</hi> or more of this light from other places. God continue to us the light of this Reformation, without re-admitting any old Clouds, any old Clouts, and we ſhall not need any ſuch re-Reformation, or ſuper-Reformation, as ſwimming Brains will needs croſs the Seas for. <hi>The Word of God is not above thee,</hi> ſays <hi>Moſes, nor beyond the Sea.</hi> We need not clime up ſeven hills, nor waſh our ſelves ſeven times in a Lake for it: God make the practiſe of our lives agreeable to the Doctrine of our Church; and all the world ſhall ſee that we have light enough.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Illuxit Mundo, Illuxit Nobis,</hi> and <hi>Vobis</hi> too; God hath alſo ſhin'd ſufficiently upon every of you, that hear this, already: upon the greateſt part of you in both, upon all in one of his Sacraments. God hath been content to talk with you in your infancy, as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents with their children, before they can ſpeak plain, in his Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Catechiſms; and ſince you came to better ſtrength, in his ſtronger Language of Preaching. He hath admitted you to him in your private prayers, and come to you in your private readings of his Word. He hath opened your Ears to him, and his to hear you in the publick Congregation: and as he that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters his Garden, pours in water into that Veſſel at one place, and pours it out again at an hundred; God, who as he hath wall'd this Iſland with a wall of water, the Sea; ſo he waters this Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with the waters of Paradiſe: the VVord of Life hath pour'd in this water, into that great, and Royal Veſſel, the Underſtanding,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:93368:196"/>
and the love of his truth, into the large and religious heart of our Soveraign, and he pours it out in 100, in 1000 ſpouts, in a more plentiful preaching thereof, then ever your Fathers had it; in both the ways of plenty; plentiful in the frequency, plentiful in the learned manner of preaching. <hi>Illuxit,</hi> he hath ſhin'd upon you before you were born, in the Covenant, in making you the Children of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of Chriſtian Parents. <hi>Illuxit,</hi> he hath ſhin'd upon you ever ſince you could hear and ſee, had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny exerciſe of natural and ſupernatural faculties; and <hi>Illuxit,</hi> by his grace, who ſends treaſure in earthen veſſels, he hath ſhin'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome of you, ſince you came hither now. Conſider onely now, after all this ſhining, that a Candle is as ſoon blown out, at an open door, or an open window, as in the open ſtreet. If you o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen a door to a Supplanter, an Underminer, a Whiſperer againſt your Religion; if there be a broken window, a woman loaden with ſin, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, and thereby dejected into an inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate melancholy, (for ſuch a melancholy as make Witches, makes Papiſts too) if ſhe be thereby as apt to change Religions now, as Loves before, and as weary of this God, as of that man; if there be ſuch a door, ſuch a window, a wife, a child, a friend, a ſojourner bending that way, this light that hath ſhin'd upon thee, may as abſolutely go out, in thy houſe, and in thy heart, as if it were put out in the whole Kingdom. Leave the publick to him whoſe care the publick is; and who, no doubt, prepares a good account to him, to whom onely he is accountable. Look then to thine own heart, and thine own houſe; for that's thy charge. And ſo we have done with the action, ſhining, evidence; and with the time, <hi>Illuxit,</hi> there is enough done already; and we come to the place, <hi>in Corde;</hi> if God ſhine, he ſhines in the heart.</p>

But why do I ſpeak all this to others? Is it ſo clear a caſe, that the hearts in this Text, are the hearts of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; of them that hear, and not of our ſelves that ſpeak?

If we take Gods Word into our mouths, and pretend a Commiſſion, a Calling, for the calling of others, we muſt be ſure that God hath ſhin'd in our hearts. There is <hi>vocatio intentionalis,</hi> an intentional Calling, when Parents, in their intention and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, dedicates their children to this ſervice of God, the Miniſtry, even in their Cradle. And this is a good and holy intention, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe though it bind not in the nature of a Vow, yet it makes them all the way more careful, to give them ſuch an Education, as may fit them for that profeſſion. And then there is <hi>Vocatio Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alis,</hi> when having aſſented to that purpoſe of my Parents, I receive that publick Seal, the Impoſition of hands, in the Church of God: but it is <hi>Vocatio radicalis,</hi> the calling that is the root and foundation of all, that we have this light ſhining in our hearts, the teſtimony of Gods Spirit to our ſpirit, that we have this call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from above. Firſt then, it muſt be a light; not a calling ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the darkneſs of melancholy, or darkneſs of diſcontent, or darkneſs of want and poverty, or darkneſs of a retir'd life, to avoid the mutual duties and offices of ſociety: it muſt be a light, and a light that ſhines; it is not enough to have knowledge and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; it muſt ſhine out, and appear in preaching; and it muſt ſhine in our hearts, in the private teſtimony of the Spirit there: but when it hath ſo ſhin'd there, it muſt not go out there, but ſhine ſtill as a Candle in a Candleſtick, or the Sun in his ſphere; ſhine ſo, as it give light to others: ſo that this light doth not ſhine in our hearts, except it appear in the tongue, and in the hand too: Firſt, in the tounge, to preach opportune, and importune; <hi>in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and out of ſeaſon;</hi>

I muſt preach. And in that ſenſe, I may uſe the words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>As much as in me is, I am ready to preach the Goſpel to them alſo that are at Rome:</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> in their hearts; at <hi>Rome,</hi> that is, of <hi>Rome,</hi>

And therefore let this light ſhine in our hearts, in the teſtimony of a good Conſcience, in having accepted this Calling, but alſo ſhine in our tongues, preach.

            <p>It muſt ſhine there, and it muſt ſhine in our hands alſo, in our actions, in the example of our life.

Clearly and ingenuouſly, we, we the Miniſters of the Goſpel, acknowledge our ſelves to be principally intended by the Apoſtle in this Text; this light, that is the knowledge, and the love of Gods truth, muſt ſhine in our hearts, ſincerely there; and in our tongues, aſſidiouſly there; and in our hands, evidently there; and ſo we are the perſons; but yet not we alone, though the Apoſtle expreſs it in that phraſe, <hi>in Cordibus noſtris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When this Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>Hereditas nostra,</hi> our inheritance; and <hi>Pax noſtra,</hi> our peace; and <hi>Spes noſtra,</hi> our hope, as he does to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> and often elſewhere, he does not ſo appropriate Chriſt, of whom he ſays all that, to himſelf, as that they to whom he writes, ſhould not have an inheritance, and a peace, and a hope in Chriſt, as well as he, or any Apoſtle. So when he ſays here <hi>in Cordibus noſtris, in our hearts,</hi> he intends that the <hi>Coloſsians,</hi> that people to whom he writes, (and he writes to all) ſhould have that light in their hearts, and conſequently in their tongues and hands too; in words and actions, as well as men of the Church. It is not onely to Prieſts that St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.9.</note>

Conſider how much other Profeſſions, of Arms, of Merchandiſe, of Agriculture, of Law it ſelf, are decay'd of late: and thence, (though not only thence) it is, that ſo many more in our times, then ever before, of Honorable and Worſhipful Families, apply themſelves to our Profeſſion, to the Miniſtry. Let therefore <hi>this light ſhine in your hearts,</hi> bleſs God for this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed increaſe, and ſhine in your tongues; glorifie God in a good interpretation of the actions of his Miniſters, and ſhine in your hands; cheriſh and comfort them ſo, that they be not put to bread and water, that give you bread and wine; nor mourn in ſmoaky corners, who bring you the Sun-ſhine of the glorious Goſpel, the Goſpel of conſolation, into the congregation. And ſo we have done with all the four conſiderations, which made up this firſt branch, our Vocation by <hi>this Light,</hi> conſider'd poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The Thing, the Time, the Place, and the Perſons.

Which words by the way give juſt occaſion of making this ſhort note, that many times by altercation and vehemence of Diſputation, the truth of the literal ſenſe is indangered: and therefore we ſhould rather content our ſelves with poſitive and neceſſary Divinity, then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle our ſelves with impertinent controverſies. The <hi>Manichees,</hi> and thoſe other Hereticks, who conſtituted <hi>Duo Principia,</hi> and
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:93368:199"/>
conſequently two Gods, one good, and one bad, made uſe of this Text for that opinion; That if the Devil were God of this world, and if any God did blinde the eyes of man, there was an ill <hi>God.</hi> And to elevate and take away that Argument of thoſe Hereticks, very many of the ancient Fathers, <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> litterally and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and expreſly and literally <hi>S. Chryſ.</hi> too, and <hi>S. Aug.</hi> ſays, moſt of the Orthodox Fathers would needs read that place with another diſtinction another interpunction then indeed belongs to it, not <hi>Deus hujus ſaeculi, The God of this world hath blinded man;</hi> but <hi>Deus, hujus ſaeculi mentes,</hi> God, that is, the true God, hath blinded the eyes of the men of this world. And ſo, for fear of giving the name of God to the Devil, they attribute the action of the Devil to God. I doe not mean that the Fathers doe it, they were far from it; but this ſhift, and this inconvenient manner of expreſſing themſelves, hath made ſome later men who think ſo, think, that the Fathers thought God to be really, poſitively, primarily, the author of the excaecation of the Reprobates. In what ſenſe that may be ſaid, how, and how far God concurs to this excaecation, we diſpute not now. We reſt in that of <hi>St. Aug. Aliud venit de aſtutia ſuaden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, aliud de nequitia nolentis, aliud de juſtitia punientis.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> God hath a part, a great part, in this; but not the firſt. Firſt, ſays <hi>St. Aug.</hi> Satan ſuggeſts, then man conſents; then enters God, by way of puniſhment, of Juſtice. And how far doth he puniſh? <hi>Deſerendo,</hi> he forſakes that ſinner, he withdraws his Grace: and then, as upon the departing of the Sun, darkneſs follows, but the Sun is not the cauſe of darkneſs; ſo upon departing of Grace, follows excaecation. God, our God, is the God of light, and <hi>lightneth every man that cometh into the world.</hi> So he begun in the Creation, ſo he proceeds in our Vocation, <hi>As he commanded light of darkneſs, ſo he hath ſhin'd in our hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>He made light:</hi> There was none before; ſo firſt, <hi>He ſhines in our hearts,</hi> by his preventing Grace; there was no light before; not of Nature, by which any man could ſee, any means of ſalvation; not of foreſeen Merits, that God ſhould light his light at our Candle, give us Grace therefore, becauſe he ſaw that we would uſe that Grace well. He made light, he infus'd Grace.</p>
            <p>And then, <hi>He made light firſt of all Creatures: Ut innoteſcerent,</hi> ſays, St. <hi>Ambr.</hi> that by that light all his other Creatures might be ſeen: which is alſo the uſe of this other light, that <hi>ſhines in our hearts,</hi> that by that light, the love of the Truth, and the glory of Chriſt Jeſus, all our actions may be manifeſted to the world, and abide that tryal; that we look for no other approbation of them, then as they are juſtifiable by that light, as they conduce to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of his Religion, and the advancement of his glory: not to conſider actions as they are wiſely done, valiantly done, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:93368:200"/>
done, but onely as they are religiouſly done: and <hi>ut abdice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus occulta dedecoris,</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 2.</note> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks; <hi>That we may renounce the hidden things of diſhoneſty, and not walk in craftineſs:</hi> that is, not ſin therefore, becauſe we ſee our ſins may be hid from the world: For, ſays St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Gyges</hi> Ring, a Ring by which he that wore it, became inviſible; <hi>Da ſapienti;</hi> ſays that Father, Give a wiſe man, (a man religiouſly wiſe) that Ring, and though he might ſin inviſibly before men, he would not, becauſe God ſees. Nay,<note place="margin">Seneca.</note> even the moral man goes further then that, in that point; Though I knew, ſays he, <hi>hominem ignoraturum, &amp; Deum ignoſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> that man ſhould never know it, and that God would forgive it, I would not ſin, for the very ſoulneſs that is naturally in ſin. As God commanded light for the Manifeſtation of his creatures, ſo he hath ſhin'd in our hearts, that our actions might appear by that light.</p>
            <p>How then made he that light? <hi>Dixit,</hi> he ſaid it, by his Word. In which we note, firſt, the means: <hi>Verbo;</hi> he did it by his Word; and by his Word, the preaching of his Word, doth he ſhine in our hearts. And we conſider alſo the diſpatch, how ſoon he made light,<note place="margin">Chryſost.</note> with a word. <hi>Dixit, id eſt, ſumma cum celeritate fecit,</hi> his work coſt him but a word;<note place="margin">Tertul.</note> and then <hi>Cogitaſſe juſsiſſe est,</hi> his word coſt him but a thought. So if we conſider the diſpatch of Chriſt Jeſus in all his Miracles, there went but a <hi>Tolle, Take up thy bed and walk,</hi> to the lame man; but an <hi>Ephptata, Be opened,</hi> to the deaf man; but a <hi>Quid vides, What ſeest thou?</hi> to the blind man. If we conſider his diſpatch upon the thief on the croſs, how ſoon he brought him from reviling, to glorifying; and if any in this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory feel that diſpatch of the Holy Ghoſt, in his heart; that whereas he came hither but to ſee, he hath heard; or if he came to hear the man, he hath heard God in the man, and is better at this Glaſs, then he was at the firſt; better now, then when he came, and will go away better then he is yet, he that feels this, muſt confeſs, that as <hi>God commanded light out of darkneſs, ſo he hath ſhin'd in his heart: So,</hi> that is, by the ſame means, by his Word; and ſo, that is, with the ſame ſpeed and diſpatch.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Deus vidit lucem,</hi> God ſaw the light; he looked upon it; he conſidered it: This ſecond light, even Religion it ſelf, muſt be looked upon, conſidered; not taken implicitely, nor occaſionally, not advantageouſly, but ſeriouſly and deliberately, and then aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly, and conſtantly.</p>
            <p>And then <hi>vidit quod bona,</hi> God ſaw that this light was good; God did not ſee, nor ſay that darkneſs was good; that ignorance, how near of kin ſoever they make it to Devotion, was good; nor that the waters were good; that a flui'd, a moving, a variable, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain irreſolution in matter of Religion, is good; nor that that <hi>Abyſſus,</hi> that depth which was before light, was good; that it is
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:93368:200"/>
good to ſurround and enwrap our ſelves in deep and perplexing School-points, but he ſaw that light, evident and fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Articles of Religion, were good, good to clear thee in all ſcruples, good to ſuſtain thee in all tentations. God knew that this light would be good, before he made it; but he did not ſay ſo, till he ſaw it. God knew every good work that thou ſhouldeſt doe, every good thought that thou ſhouldeſt think to thy end, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy beginning, for he of his own goodneſs, imprinted this degree of goodneſs in thee; but yet aſſure thy ſelf, that he loves thee in another manner, and another meaſure, then, when thou comeſt really to doe thoſe good works, then before, or when thou didſt only conceive a purpoſe of doing them: he calls them good when he ſees them.</p>
            <p>And when <hi>he ſaw this light,</hi> this good light, <hi>he ſeparated all dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from it.</hi> When thou haſt found this light to have ſhin'd in thy heart, God manifeſted in his way, his true Religion, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate all darkneſs, the dark inventions and traditions of men, and the works of darkneſs, ſin; and ſince thou haſt light, be night not thy ſelf again, with relapſing to either.</p>
            <p>The compariſon of theſe two lights, created and infus'd light, would run <hi>in infinitum;</hi> I ſhut it up with this, that as at the firſt production of light, till light was made, there was a general, an univerſal darkneſs, darkneſs over all, but after light was once made, there was never any univerſal darkneſs, becauſe there is no body bigg enough to ſhadow the whole Sun from the Earth; ſo till <hi>this light ſhine in our hearts,</hi> we are wholly darkneſs; but when it hath truly and effectually ſhin'd in us, and manifeſted to us the evidence of our Election in Gods eternal Decree, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there may be ſome Clouds, ſome Eclipſes, yet there is no to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal darkneſs, no total, no final falling away of Gods Saints. And in all theſe reſpects, the compariſon holds. <hi>As God commanded light out of darkneſs, ſo he hath ſhin'd in our hearts;</hi> and ſo we have done with all the branches of our ſecond part, which implies our Vocation here, and we paſs to the laſt, Our Glorification here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>As in our firſt part we conſider'd by occaſion of the firſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, light, the whole Creation, and ſo the Creation of man;<note place="margin">Part III.</note> and in our ſecond part, by occaſion <hi>of this ſhining in our hearts,</hi> the whole work of our Vocation and proceeding in this world: ſo in this third part, by occaſion of this <hi>glorious manifestation of God, in the face of Christ Jeſus,</hi> which is intended principally, by this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, of, the <hi>manifeſtation of God in the Chriſtian Church;</hi> we ſhall alſo, as far, as that dazling glory will give us leave, conſider the perfect ſtate of glory in the Kingdom of Heaven: So that firſt, our branches in this third part, will be three, theſe three terms, 1 <hi>Knowledge,</hi> 2 <hi>Glory,</hi> and then, <hi>the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Diviſio.</note> And
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:93368:201"/>
then we muſt look upon all theſe three terms two ways, firſt, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choative,</hi> how we have an inchoation <hi>of this knowledge,</hi> of this <hi>glory, in this face of Chriſt Jeſus</hi> here in the Church; and then <hi>Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative,</hi> how we ſhall have a conſummation of all this hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Scientia.</note>To us then, who were created of nothing, in the firſt part, and called from the Gentiles in the ſecond, in this third part, our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to glory, is knowledge. The Perſons in this part of the Text, are, as in the former; <hi>Not only we,</hi> we the Miniſters of Gods Word, but you alſo the hearers thereof: for there is a knowledge, an art of hearing, as well as of ſpeaking. Students make up the Univerſity, as well as Doctors: and Hearers make up the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, as well as Preachers. A good hearer is as much a Doctor, as a Preacher: A Doctor to him that ſits by him, in example, whilſt he is here: a Doctor to all his Family, in his repetition, when he comes home: a Doctor, to that which is more then the whole world, to him, his own ſoul, all his life. Chriſt appear'd to this Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Act. 26.16.</note> and ſaid, <hi>I have appeared unto thee, for this purpoſe, to make thee a Miniſter and a witneſs, to open the Gentiles eyes, and to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</hi> There he received his Degree, his learning, and the uſe of it; but when <hi>St. Paul</hi> came abroad into the world, when he comes to preach,<note place="margin">1.12.</note> and to write, he ſays to the <hi>Coloſ. The Father hath made us meet to be partakes of the inheritance of the Saints in his light.</hi> Us, ſays <hi>St. Chryſoſt,</hi> and ſo ſays <hi>Theophylact</hi> too, and many more then they two; Us, that is, all Us, Us that preach, you that hear; you are bound to ſtudy this knowledge, as well as we. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a Hearer hath in ſome reſpects advantage of the Preacher: for, a Preacher, though in ſome meaſure, well diſpos'd, can hardly <hi>exuere hominem,</hi> put off the affections of man, by being a Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; they ſtick cloſer to him then his Hood and habit, even in the Pulpit. Some little Clouds, if not of oſtentation, and vain glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yet of complacencie and ſelf-pleaſing, will affect him; the hearer hath not that tentation, but hath herein a more perfect ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the moſt Chriſtian vertue, <hi>Humility,</hi> then the preacher hath. Though therefore, when you caſt your eye upon this part of this Text, you ſee in your Book, a difference of Character, in this word, <hi>To give, to give light,</hi> &amp;c. which ſeems to fix all upon the perſon of the Apoſtle, and conſequently of the Miniſter; yet that word is not in the Text, but the Text is only, <hi>for the inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; God hath ſhin'd, for the inlightning,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which is alike upon all; and therefore let us, all us, cast off the works of darkneſs, and put on the armor of light:</hi> light it ſelf is faith; but, the armor of light is knowledge; an ignorant man is a diſarm'd man, a naked man.</p>
            <p>Ignorance then is not our Uſher into this preſence, <hi>to ſhew us the face of Christ Jeſus:</hi> almoſt in every one of the ancient Fathers, you ſhall find ſome paſſages, wherein they diſcover an inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:93368:201"/>
to that opinion, that before Chriſt came in the manifeſtation of his Goſpel (for, ſince that coming, every man is bound to ſee him there) many Philoſophers, men of knowledge, and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, were ſav'd without the knowledge of Chriſt. <hi>Christus Ratio,</hi> ſays one of them, well, (for <hi>Logos,</hi> is, <hi>Ratio,</hi> and not only <hi>Verbum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Juſtin Martyr.</note> as it is ordinarily tranſlated) Chriſt is Reaſon, rectified Reaſon; and <hi>ſecundum Rationem vixerunt, Chriſtiani ſemper,</hi> ſays he, Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever lives according to rectified Reaſon, which is the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he is a Chriſtian; and therefore, when that Father, <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> who had been before a Philoſopher amongſt the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, came to be a Preacher amongſt the Chriſtians, he never left off his Philoſophers habit, becauſe that gave an impreſſion of his learning, and an eſtimation by it. That knowledge was a help to ſalvation, the Ancients thought: but that is a new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that men ſhould make a title to God, by being ignorant: that whereas all the life of man, is either an active life, or a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative, they ſhould in the <hi>Romane</hi> Church make one Order, and call them <hi>Nullanos,</hi> men that did nothing, in contempt of the active life, and in contempt of the contemplative life; another Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whom they call <hi>Ignorantes,</hi> men that know nothing. There is an annihilation in ſin; <hi>Homines cum peccam, nihil ſunt:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> Then when by ſin, I depart from the Lord my God, <hi>in whom only I live, and move, and have my being,</hi> I am nothing: and truly, in this ſinful profeſſion of thine, of doing nothing, of knowing nothing, they come too neer being nothing. What other anſwer can this knowing nothing, here, produce at the laſt day, from Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, but his <hi>Neſcio vos,</hi> I know not you? As <hi>David</hi> ſays of God,<note place="margin">Pſal. 18.26.</note> 
               <hi>Cum perverſo perverteris,</hi> With the froward God will be froward; ſo, <hi>Ignorantes ignorabit,</hi> of the ignorant, God will be ignorant; not know them, that ſtudy not knowledge. The miracle that Chriſt wrought in the converſion of the World, was not, that he wrought upon men by Apoſtles, that were unlearned; for the Apoſtles were not ſo; they were never unprovided to give a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent and ſatisfactory anſwer to the learnedeſt of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers amongſt the Gentiles, to any of the <hi>Gamaliels</hi> and <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſſes,</hi> who were true underſtanders of the Law amongſt the Jews; to any of their Scribes, the perverters of the Law; to any of the Phariſees, their Separatiſts, and Schiſmaticks; to any of the Sadduces, their formal Hereticks; nor to any of their <hi>Herodians,</hi> their <hi>State</hi>-Divines, who made Divinity ſerve preſent turns, and occaſions: The Apoſtles were no ignorant men, then, when they were imployed: but in this conſiſted the Miracle, that in an inſtant Chriſt by his Spirit, infus'd all knowledge, neceſſary for that great function, into them. If they had not had it, they could not have done his work. All muſt have it; <hi>Intelligite Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> ſays <hi>David;</hi> for all their buſineſs, Kings muſt ſtudy for it: <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rudimini

               <note place="margin">Pſa. 2.

'Tis true, he is a Lyon too; but he was a Serpent firſt; and did us more harm as a Serpent, then as a Lyon. But now, as Chriſt Jeſus hath nail'd his hand-writing, which he had againſt us, to the Croſs, and thereby cancelled his evidence; ſo in his deſcent to hell, and ſubſequent acts of his glorification, he hath burnt his Library, annihilated his wiſdom, in giving us a wiſdome above his craft; he hath ſhin'd in our hearts by the knowledge of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>

            <p>It is a good definition of ill love, that St. <hi>Chryſost.</hi> gives, that it is <hi>Animae vacantis paſsio,</hi> a paſſion of an empty ſoul, of an idle mind.

you are not happy till you do them; that's true: but ye can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do them, till ye know them. Zeal furthers our ſalvation; but it muſt be <hi>Secundum ſcientiam,</hi> Zeal according to knowledge. Works further our ſalvation; but not works done in our ſleep, ſtupidly, caſually, nor erroniouſly, but upon ſuch grounds as fall within our knowledge to be good. Faith moſt of all furthers and advances our ſalvation; but a man cannot believe that which he does not know. Conſcience includes ſcience; it is knowledge, and more; but it is that firſt. It is, as we expreſs it in the School, <hi>Syllogiſmus practicus.</hi> I have a good Conſcience in having done well; but I did that upon a former knowledge, that that ought to be done. God hath ſhined in our hearts, to give us the light of knowledge, that was the firſt; and then, <hi>of the knowledge of the glory of God,</hi> that is our ſecond term, in this firſt acceptation of the Word. The light of the knowledge of the glory of this world,<note place="margin">Gloria Dei.</note> is a good, and a great peece of learning. To know, that all the glory of man, is as the flower of graſs: that even the glory,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.24.</note> and all the glory, of man, of all mankind, is but a flower, and but as a flower, ſomewhat leſs then the Proto-type, then the Original, then the flower it ſelf; and all this but as the flower of graſs neither, no very beautiful flower to the eye, no very fragrant flower to the ſmell: To know, that for the glory of <hi>Moab, Auferetur,</hi>

            <p>It is a Book of an old Edition, to put you upon the conſideration what great and glorious men have loſt their glory in this world: Give me leave to preſent to you a new Book, a new conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; not how others have loſt, but conſider onely how you have got that glory which you have in this world: conſider adviſedly, and confeſs ingeniouſly, whether you have not known many men, more induſtrious then ever you were, and yet never attained to the glory of your Wealth?

And this is a heavenly art, a divine knowledge; that if God ſend a peſtilence amongſt us, we Come not to ſay, it was a great fruit year, and therefore there muſt follow a plague in reaſon: That if God ſwallow up an invincible Navy, we come to ſay, There was a ſtorm, and there muſt follow a ſcattering in reaſon: That if God diſcover a Mine, we come not to ſay, there was a falſe Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that writ a Letter, and there muſt follow a diſcovery in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but remember ſtill, that though in <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms, there be Pſalms of Prayer, and Pſalms of Praiſe; Pſalms of Deprecation, and of Imprecation too; how divers ſoever the nature of the Pſalm be, yet the Church hath appointed to ſhut up every Pſalm with that one Acclamation, <hi>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,</hi> &amp;c. Whether I pray, or praiſe; depricate Gods Judgements from my ſelf, or imprecate them upon pods enemies, nothing can fall from me, nothing can fall upon me, but that God may receive glory by it, if I will glorifie him in it. So that then, in a uſeful ſenſe, <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria Dei,</hi> is <hi>Gloria Deo;</hi> but yet more literally, more directly, the glory of God in this place, is the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt Jeſus: which is that which is intended, and expreſſed in the next phraſe, which is the laſt Branch; in this firſt acceptation of theſe words, <hi>in facie, The glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

and ſo ſome of the Angels know that, which the reſt, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, doe not know. By Creation, they know as his Subjects; by Confirmation, they know as his ſervants; by Revelation, they know as his Councel. Now, <hi>Erimus ſicut Angeli,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>There we ſhall be as the Angels:</hi> The knowledge which I have by Nature, ſhall have no Clouds; here it hath: that which I have by Grace, ſhall have no reluctation, no reſiſtance; here it hath: That which I have by Revelation, ſhall have no ſuſpition, no jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie; here it hath: ſometimes it is hard to diſtinguiſh between a reſpiration from God, and a ſuggeſtion from the Devil.

We ſhall not paſs from Author, to Author, as in a Grammar School, nor from Art to Art, as in an Univerſity; but, as that General which Knighted his whole Army, God ſhall Create us all Doctors in a minute.

Be therefore no ſtrangers to this face: ſee him here, that you may know him, and he you, there: ſee him, as St. <hi>John</hi> did, who turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee a voice: ſee him in the preaching of his Word; ſee him in that ſeal, which is a Copy of him, as he is of his Father;<note place="margin">Apoc. 1.</note> ſee him in the Sacrament. Look him in the face as he lay in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, poor, and then murmur not at temporal wants; ſuddainly enrich'd by the Tributes of Kings, and doubt not but that God hath large and ſtrange ways to ſupply thee. Look him in the face, in the Temple, diſputing there at twelve years; and then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply thy ſelf to God, to the contemplation of him, to the medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon him, to a converſation with him betimes. Look him in the face in his Fathers houſe; a Carpenter, and but a Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Take a Calling, and contain thy ſelf in that Calling. But
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:93368:206"/>
bring him nearer, and look him in the face, as he look'd upon Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day laſt; when he whoſe face the Angels deſire to look on, he who was fairer then the children of men,<note place="margin">Pſa. 45.3. Eſai 52.14.53.3.</note> as the Prophet ſpeaks, was ſo marr'd more then any man, as another Prophet ſays, <hi>That they hid their faces from him, &amp; deſpiſed him; when he who bore up the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens bowed down his head, &amp; he who gives breath to all, gave up the ghoſt:</hi> and then look him in the face again, as he look'd yeſterday, not lam'd upon the Croſs, not putrifi'd in the Grave, not ſinged in Hell, rais'd, and raiſed by his own power, Victoriouſly, trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly, to the deſtruction of the laſt Enemy, death; look him in the face in all theſe reſpects, of Humiliation, and of Exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on too; and then, as a Picture look upon him, that look upon it, God upon whom thou keepeſt thine Eye, will keep his Eye upon thee, and, as in the Creation, when <hi>he commanded light out of darkneſs,</hi> he gave thee a capacity of this light; and as in thy Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, when <hi>he ſhin'd in thy heart,</hi> he gave thee an inchoation of this light, ſo in aſſociating thee to himſelf at the laſt day, he will perfect, conſummate, accompliſh all, and give thee <hi>the light of the glory of God, in the face of Chriſt Jeſus</hi> there.</p>
            <p>This is the laſt word of our Text: but we make up our Circle by returning to the firſt word; the firſt word is, <hi>For;</hi> for the Text is reaſon of that which is in the Verſe immediately before the Text; that is, We preach not our ſelves, <hi>but Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, and our ſelves your ſervants, for Jeſus ſake.</hi> We ſtop not on this ſide Chriſt Jeſus; we dare not ſay, that any man is ſav'd without Chriſt; we dare ſay, that none can be ſaved, that hath received that light, and hath not beleev'd in him. We carry you not beyond Chriſt neither, not beyond that face of his, in which he is manifeſted, the Scriptures. Till you come to Chriſt <hi>you are without God,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſays to the <hi>Epheſians:</hi> and when you goe beyond Chriſt, to Traditions of men, you are without God too. There is a <hi>fine Deo,</hi> a left handed Atheiſm, in the meer natural man, that will not know Chriſt; and there is a <hi>ſine Deo,</hi> a right handed Atheiſm in the ſtubborn Papiſt, who is not content with Chriſt. They preach Chriſt Jeſus and themſelves, and make themſelves Lords over you in Jeſus, place, and farther then ever he went. <hi>We preach not our ſelves, but him, and our ſelves your ſervants for his ſake;</hi> and this is our ſervice, to tell you the whole compaſs, the beginning, the way, and the end of all, that all is done in, and by, and for Chriſt Jeſus, that from thence flow, and thither lead, and there determine all, to bring you, from the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of your Creation, by the ſenſe of your Vocation, to the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of your glorification, by the manifeſtation of God in Chriſt, and Chriſt in the Scriptures, <hi>For, God who commanded light out of darkneſs, hath ſhin'd,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>BUildings ſtand by the benefit of their foundations that ſuſtain them, ſupport them; and of their buttreſſes that compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them, embrace them; and of their contignations that knit and unite them. The foundation ſuffers them not to ſink; the buttreſſes ſuffer them not to ſwerve; the contignation and knitting, ſuffer them not to cleave. The body of our building is in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of this verſe; it is this; <hi>He that is our God, is the God of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; ad ſalutes,</hi> of ſalvations in the plural, ſo it is in the original; the God that gives us ſpiritual and temporal ſalvation too. But of this building, the foundation, the buttreſſes, the contignation are in this part of the verſe, which conſtitutes our text, and in the three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe acceptations of the words amongſt our expoſitors, <hi>Unto God the Lord belong the iſſues of death.</hi> For, firſt the foundation of this buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, (that our God is the God of all ſalvations) is laid in this, <hi>That unto this God the Lord belongs the iſſues of death;</hi> that is, it is his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to give us an iſſue and deliverance, even then when we are brought to the jaws and teeth of death, and to the lips of that whirl-pool, the grave; and ſo in this acceptation, this <hi>exitus mortis,</hi> this iſſue of death is <hi>liberatio a morie,</hi> a deliverance from death; &amp; this is the moſt obvious, and moſt ordinary acceptation of theſe words, and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which, our tranſlation laies hold, <hi>The iſſues from death.</hi> And then, Secondly, the buttreſſes, that comprehend and ſettle this building; that <hi>He that is our God is the God of ſalvation</hi> are thus raiſed; <hi>Unto God the Lord belong the iſſues of death,</hi> that is, the diſpoſition and manner of our death, what kind of iſſue, and tranſmigration we ſhall have out of this world, whether prepared or ſodain, whether violent or natural, whether in our perfect ſenſes, or ſhak'd and diſordered by ſickneſs; there is no condemnation to be argued out of that, no judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be made upon that, for howſoever they dye; <hi>precious in his ſight, is the death of his Saints,</hi> and with him are the iſſues of death, the way of our departing out of this life, are in his hands; and ſo, in this ſenſe of the words, this <hi>Exitus mortis,</hi> the iſſue of death, is <hi>libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:93368:207"/>
in morte,</hi> a deliverance in death; not that God will deliver us from dying, but that he will have a care of us in the hour of death, of what kind ſoever our paſſage be; and this ſenſe, and acceptation of the words, the natural frame &amp; contexture doth well and pregnantly adminiſter unto us. And then laſtly, the contignation and knitting of this building, that he that is our God, is the God of all ſalvation, conſiſts in this, <hi>Unto this God the Lord belong the iſſues of death,</hi> that is, that this God the Lord having united and knit both natures in one, and being God, having alſo come into this world, in our fleſh, he could have no other means to ſave us, he could have no other iſſue out of this world, nor return to his former glory, but by death. And ſo in this ſenſe, this <hi>exitus mortis,</hi> the iſſue of death, is <hi>liberatio per mortem,</hi> a deliverance by death, by the death of this God our Lord, Chriſt Jeſus; and this is St. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> acceptation of the words, and thoſe many and great perſons, that have adhered to him. In all theſe three lines then, we ſhall look upon theſe words; firſt, as the God of power, the Almighty Father, reſcues his ſervants from the jaws of death; and then, as the God of mercy, the glorious Son, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcued us, by taking upon himſelf the iſſue of death; and then, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two,) as the God of comfort, the holy Ghoſt reſcues us from all diſcomfort by his bleſſed impreſſions before hand, that what manner of death ſoever be ordained for us, yet this <hi>exitus mortis,</hi> ſhall be <hi>introitus in vitam,</hi> our iſſue in death, ſhall be an entrance into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting life. And theſe three conſiderations, our deliverance <hi>a morte, in morte, per mortem,</hi> from death, in death, and by death, will abundantly do all the offices of the foundation, of the buttreſſes, of the contignation of this our building, that <hi>He that is our God, is the God of all ſalvation,</hi> becauſe <hi>Unto this God the Lord belong the iſſues of death.</hi>

               <hi>I am won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully and fearfully made,</hi> and, <hi>Such knowledg is too excellent for me;</hi> for, <hi>Even that is the Lords doing, and it is wonderful in our eyes.</hi>

               <hi>Ipſe fecit nos,</hi> It is he that hath made us, and not we our ſelves, no,<note place="margin">200. 3.</note> nor our Parents neither. <hi>Thy hands have made me, and faſhioned me round about,</hi> ſaies <hi>Job;</hi> and,<note place="margin">10. 8.</note> (as the original word is) <hi>Thou haſt taken pains about me;</hi> and yet ſaies he, <hi>Thou doeſt deſtroy me:</hi> though I be the maſter-peice of the greateſt Maſter, (man is ſo) yet if thou do no more for me, if thou leave me where thou mad'ſt me, deſtruction will follow. The womb which ſhould be the houſe of life, becomes death it ſelf, if God leave us there. That which God threatens ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, the ſhutting of the womb, is not ſo heavy nor ſo diſcomfortable a curſe, in the firſt as in the latter ſhutting; not in the ſhutting of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs, as in the ſhutting of weakneſs,<note place="margin">Eſa. 37 3.</note> when Children are come to the birth, and there is not ſtrength to bring forth.

               <hi>give them a miſ-car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying womb.</hi> Therefore as ſoon as we are men, (that is, inanimated; quickned in the womb) though we cannot our ſelves, our Parents have reaſon to ſay in our behalves, <hi>Wretched man that he is, who ſhall deliver him from this body of death?</hi> for,<note place="margin">Ro. 7.24.</note> even the womb is the body of death, if there be no deliverer. It muſt be he that ſaid to <hi>Jeremy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Before I formed thee I knew thee, and before thou cameſt out of the womb I ſanctified thee.</hi> We are not ſure that there was no kind of ſhip nor boat to fiſh in, nor to paſs by, till God preſcribed <hi>Noah</hi> that abſolute forme of the Ark; that word which the holy Ghoſt by <hi>Moſes,</hi> uſes for the Ark, is common to all kinds of boats, <hi>Thebah;</hi> and is the ſame word that <hi>Moſes</hi> uſes for the boat that he was expoſed in, that his mother laid him in an Ark of bullruſhes.<note place="margin">Exo 2.3.</note> But we are ſure that <hi>Eve</hi> had no Midwife when ſhe was delivered of <hi>Cain;</hi> therefore ſhe might well ſay, <hi>Poſſedi virum a Domino,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 4.1.</note> I have gotten a man from the Lord; wholly, intirely from the Lord: it is the Lord that hath ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled me to conceive, the Lord hath infus'd a quickning ſoul into that conception, the Lord hath brought into the world that which himſelf had quickned; without all this might <hi>Eve</hi> ſay, my body had been but the houſe of death, and <hi>Domini Domini ſunt exitus mortis,</hi> To God the Lord belong the iſſues of death.</p>
            <p>But then this <hi>Exitus a morte,</hi> is but <hi>Introitus in mortem,</hi> this iſſue,<note place="margin">Exitus a mor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ibus mundi.</note> this deliverance from that death, the death of the womb, is an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, a delivering over to another death, the manifold deaths of this world. We have a winding ſheet in our Mothers womb, that grows with us from our conception, and we come into the world wound up in that winding ſheet; for we come to ſeek a grave. And,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:93368:208"/>
as priſoners, diſcharged of actions, may lie for fees, ſo when the womb hath diſcharged us, yet we are bound to it by cords of fleſh, by ſuch a ſtring, as that we cannot go thence, nor ſtay there. We celebrate our own funeral with cries, even at our birth, as though our threeſcore, and ten years of life were ſpent in our Mothers labor, and our Circle made up in the firſt point thereof. We beg one Baptiſm with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a ſacrament of tears; and we come into a world that laſts many ages, but we laſt not. <hi>In domo patris,</hi> (ſaies our bleſſed Saviour, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of heaven) <hi>multae manſiones,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jo. 14.2.</note> there are many, and manſions, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and durable; ſo that if a man cannot poſſeſs a martyrs houſe, (he hath ſhed no blood for Chriſt) yet he may have a confeſſors, he hath been ready to glorifie God, in the ſhedding of his blood. And if a woman cannot poſſeſs a virgins houſe (ſhe hath embrac'd the holy ſtate of marriage) yet ſhe may have a matrons houſe, ſhe hath brought forth, and brought up children in the fear of God. <hi>In domo patris,</hi> In my Fathers houſe, in heaven, there are many manſions, but here upon earth,<note place="margin">Mat. 8 20.</note> 
               <hi>The Son of man hath not where to lay his head,</hi> ſaies he himſelf, No? <hi>terram dedit filiis hominum.</hi> How then hath God given this earth to the Sons of men? He hath given them earth for their materials, to be made of earth; and he hath given them earth for their grave and ſepulture, to return and reſolve to earth; but not for their poſſeſſion.<note place="margin">Heb. 13.14.</note> 
               <hi>Here we havh no continuing City;</hi> nay no Cottage that continues; nay, no we, no perſons, no bodies that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. Whatſoever moved St. <hi>Hierome</hi> to call the journies of the Iſraelites in the wilderneſs,<note place="margin">Exo. 17.1.</note> Manſions, the word, (the word is <hi>naſang</hi>) ſignifies but a journie, but a peregrination: even the Iſrael of God hath no manſions,<note place="margin">Gen. 47 9.</note> but journies, pilgrimages in this life. By that meaſure did <hi>Jacob</hi> meaſure his life to <hi>Pharaoh, The daies of the years of my pilgrimage.</hi> And though the Apoſtle would not ſay, <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimer,</hi> that whilſt we are in the body, we are dead, yet he ſaies, <hi>pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grinamur,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5 6.</note> whilſt we are in the body, we are but in a pilgrimage, and we are abſent from the Lord. He might have ſaid dead; for this whole world is but an univerſal Church-yard, but one common grave; and the life and motion, that the greateſt perſons have in it, is but as the ſhaking of buried bodies in their graves by an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake. That which we call life, is but <hi>Hebdomada mortium,</hi> a week of deaths, ſeaven daies, ſeaven periods of our life ſpent in dying; a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeaven times over, and ther's an end. Our birth dies in Infancy, and our infancy dies in youth, and youth, and the reſt die in age; and age alſo dies, and determines all. Nor do all theſe, youth out of infancy, or age out of youth, ariſe ſo, as a Phenix out of the aſhes of another Phenix formerly dead, but as a waſp, or a ſerpent out of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion, or as a ſnake out of dung; our youth is worſe then our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, and our age worſe then our youth; our youth is hungry and thirſty after thoſe ſins which our infancy knew not, and our age is ſorry and angry that it cannot purſue thoſe ſins which our youth did.

And beſides, all the way ſo many deaths, that is, ſo many deadly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities accompany every condition, and every period of this life, as that death it ſelf would be an eaſe to them that ſuffer them. Upon this ſenſe does <hi>Job</hi> wiſh,<note place="margin">10. 18.</note> that God had not given him an iſſue from the firſt death, from the womb; <hi>Wherefore haſt thou brought me forth out of the womb?

It was a prerogative peculiar to Chriſt, not to die this death, not to ſee corruption.

But yet ſince Chriſt took ſin upon him, ſo far as made him mortal, he had it ſo far too, as might have made him ſee this corruption and incineration, though he had no original ſin in himſelf. What preſerv'd him then? did the hypoſtatical union of both natures, God and man, preſerve his fleſh from this corruption, this incineration? 'tis true that this was a moſt powerful embalming: To be embalm'd with the divine nature it ſelf, to be embalm'd with eternity, was able to preſerve him from corruption and incineration for ever: And he was embalm'd ſo, embalm'd with the divine nature, even in his body, as well as in his ſoul; for the Godhead, the divine nature, did not depart, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſtill united to his dead body in the grave. But yet for all this powerful imbalming, this hypoſtatical union of both natures, we ſee, Chriſt did die; and for all this union which made him God and man, he became no man,) for, the union of body and ſoul makes the man, and he, whoſe ſoul and body are ſeperated by death, (as long as that ſtate laſts) is, (properly) no man.) And therefore as in him, the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of body and ſoul was no diſſolution of the hypoſtatical union, ſo is there nothing that conſtrains us to ſay, that though the fleſh of Chriſt had ſeen corruption and incineration in the grave, this had been any diſſolving of the hypoſtatical union; for the divine nature, the Godhead might have remain'd with all the elements and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Chriſts body, as well as it did with the two conſtitutive parts of his perſon, his body and ſoul. This incorruption then was not in <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephs</hi> gums and ſpices; nor was it in Chriſts innocency and exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from original ſin; nor was it, (that is, it is not neceſſary to ſay it was) in the Hypoſtatical union. But this incorruptibleneſs of his fleſh,<note place="margin">Pſa. 16 10.</note> is moſt conveniently plac,d in that, <hi>non dabis, Thou wilt not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thy holy one to ſee corruption.</hi> We look no farther for cauſes or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the myſteries of our religion, but to the will and pleaſure of God.<note place="margin">Mat. 11.26.</note> Chriſt himſelf limited his inquiſition in that; <hi>Ita eſt,</hi> even ſo, father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight. Chriſts body did not ſee corruption, therefore, becauſe God had decreed that it ſhould not. The humble ſoul, (and only the humble ſoul is the religions ſoul) reſts himſelf upon Gods purpoſes, and his decrees; but then, it is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe purpoſes, and decrees of God, which he hath declared and manifeſted; not ſuch as are conceiv'd and imagin'd in our ſelves, though upon ſome probability, ſome veriſimilitude. So, in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe,<note place="margin">Act. 2.31.13.35.</note> 
               <hi>Peter</hi> proceeded in his ſermon at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſo <hi>Paul</hi> in
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:93368:209"/>
his at <hi>Antioch;</hi> they preached Chriſt to be riſen without having ſeen corruption, not only becauſe God had decreed it, but becauſe he had manifeſted that decree in his Prophet. Therefore does St. <hi>Paul</hi> cite by ſpecial number the ſecond <hi>Pſalme</hi> for that decree, and therefore both St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> cite for that place in the 16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> for,<note place="margin">v. 10.</note> when God declares his decree and purpoſe in the expreſs word of his Prophet, or when he declares it in the real execution of the decree, then he makes it ours, then he manifeſts it to us. And therefore as the myſteries of our religion are not the objects of our reaſon, but by faith we reſt in Gods decree and purpoſe, (it is ſo, O God, becauſe it is thy will it ſhould be ſo) ſo Gods decrees are ever to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the manifeſtation thereof. All manifeſtation is either in the word of God, or in the execution of the decree; and when theſe two concur and meet, it is the ſtrongeſt demonſtration that can be: when therefore I find thoſe marks of Adoption, and ſpiritual filiation, which are delivered in the word of God, to be upon me; when I find that real execution of his good purpoſe upon me, as that actually I do live under the obedience, and under the conditions which are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of adoption and ſpiritual filiation, then, and ſo long as I ſee theſe marks, and live ſo, I may ſafely comfort my ſelf in a holy cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, &amp; a modeſt infallibility of my adoption. Chriſt determins him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in that, the purpoſe of God; becauſe the purpoſe of God was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to him: S. <hi>Pet.</hi> &amp; S. <hi>Paul,</hi> determine themſelves in thoſe two waies of knowing the purpoſe of God, the word of God before, the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Decree in the fulneſs of time. It was prophecied before, ſaid they, &amp; it is perform'd now; Chriſt is riſen without ſeeing corruption.</p>
            <p>Now this which is ſo ſingularly peculiar to him, that his fleſh ſhould not ſee corruption, at his ſecond coming, his coming to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhall be extended to all that are then alive, their fleſh ſhall not ſee corruption; becauſe (as the Apoſtle ſaies, and ſaies as a ſecret, as a myſtery, <hi>behold I ſhew you a myſtery) we ſhall not all ſleep,</hi>

God ſeems to have carried the declaration of his power to a great heighth, when he ſets the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> in the vally of dry bones,<note place="margin">37. 1.</note> and ſaies, <hi>Son of man can theſe dry bones live?</hi> as though it had been impoſſible; and yet they did; the Lord laid ſinews upon them, and fleſh, and breathed into them, and they did live.

Our bleſſed Saviour admitted colluctations with Death, and a ſadneſſe even in his Soul to death, and an agony even to a bloody ſweat in his body, and expoſtulations with God, and exclamations upon the Croſſe.

And then, upon vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent deaths inflicted, as upon malefactors, Chriſt himſelf hath forbidden us by his own death to make any ill concluſion; for, his own death had thoſe impreſſions in it; he was reputed, he was executed as a Malefactor, and no doubt many of them

Mat. 9.4. Luc. 9.31.</note> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly St. <hi>Luke; Dicebant exceſſum ejus,</hi> ſaies he; they talked of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe, of his death, which was to be accompliſhed at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The word is of his <hi>Exodus,</hi> the very word of our Text, <hi>Exitus,</hi> his iſſue by death. <hi>Moſes,</hi> who in his <hi>Exodus</hi> had prefigured this iſſue of our Lord, and in paſſing Iſrael out of <hi>Egypt</hi> through the red ſea, had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told in that actual prophecy Chriſts paſſing of mankind through the ſea of his blood, and <hi>Elias,</hi> whoſe <hi>Exodus,</hi> and iſſue out of this world, was a figure of Chriſts aſcenſion, had no doubt a great ſatisfaction, in talking with our bleſſed Lord, <hi>De exceſſu ejus,</hi> of the full conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of all this in his death, which was to be accompliſhed at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi> Our meditation of his death ſhould be more viſeral, and affect us more, becauſe it is of a thing already done. The ancient Romans had a certain tenderneſs, and deteſtation of the name of death; they would not name death, no not in their wils; there they would not ſay, <hi>Si mori contingat,</hi> but <hi>Si quid humanitas contingat,</hi> not if or when I die, but when the courſe of nature is accompliſhed upon me. To us, that ſpeak daily of the death of Chriſt, (He was crucified, dead and buried) can the memory or the mention of our death be irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome or bitter? There are in theſe latter times amongſt us, that name death freely enough, and the death of God, but in blaſphemous oaths and execrations. Miſerable men, who ſhall therefore be ſaid ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to have named Jeſus, becauſe they have named him too often; and therefore hear Jeſus ſay, <hi>Neſcive vos</hi> I never knew you; becauſe they made themſelves too familiar with him. <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> talked with Chriſt of his death only in a holy and joyful ſence of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit which they and all the world were to receive by it. Diſcourſes of religion ſhould not be out of curioſity, but edification. And then they talked with Chriſt of his death, at that time when he was at the greateſt heighth of glory, that ever he admitted in this world; that is, his transfiguration. And we are afraid to ſpeak to the great men of this world of their death, but nouriſh in them a vain imagination of immortallity and immutability. But <hi>bonum eſt nobis eſſe hic,</hi> (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid there) It is good to dwell here, in this conſideration of his death, and therefore transfer we our Tabernacle, (our devotion) through ſome of theſe ſteps, which God the Lord made to his iſſue of death, that day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="404" facs="tcp:93368:213"/>Take in his whole day, from the hour that Chriſt eat the paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver upon Thurſday, to the hour in which he died the next day. Make this preſent day,<note place="margin">Conformitas</note> that day in thy devotion, and conſider what he did, and remember what you have done. Before he inſtituted and celebrated the ſacrament, (which was after the eating of the paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver) he proceeded to the act of humility, to waſh his Diſciples feet; even <hi>Peters,</hi> who for a while reſiſted him. In thy preparation to the holy and bleſſed ſacrament, haſt thou with a ſincere humilty ſought a reconciliation with all the world, even with thoſe who have been averſe from it, and refuſed that reconciliation from thee? If ſo, (and not elſe) thou haſt ſpent that firſt part, of this his laſt day, in a conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with him. After the ſacrament, he ſpent the time til night in prayer, in preaching, in Pſalms. Haſt thou conſidered that a worthy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the ſacrament conſiſts in a continuation of holineſs after, as wel as in a preparation before? If ſo, thou haſt therein alſo conformed thy ſelf to him: ſo Chriſt ſpent his time till night. At night he went into the garden to pray, and he prayed <hi>prolixius;</hi> He ſpent much time in prayer.<note place="margin">Luc. 22.24.</note> How much? becauſe it is literally expreſſed that he praied there three ſeveral times, and that returning to his Diſciples after his firſt prayer, and finding them aſleep, ſaid, <hi>could ye not watch with me one hour;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 26.40.</note> it is collected that he ſpent three houres in prayer. I dare ſcarce ask thee whither thou wentſt, or how thou diſpoſedſt of thy ſelf, when it grew dark and after laſt night. If that time were ſpent in a holy recommendation of thy ſelf to God, and a ſubmiſſion of thy will to his; that it was ſpent in a conformity to him. In that time, and in thoſe prayers was his agony and bloody ſweat. I will hope that thou didſt pray; but not every ordinary and cuſtomary prayer, but prayer actually accompanied with ſhedding of tears, and diſpoſitively, in a readineſs to ſhed blood for his glory in neceſſary caſes, puts thee into a corformity with him. About midnight he was taken and bound with a kiſs. Art thou not too conformable to him in that? Is not that too literally, too exactly thy caſe? At midnight to have been taken, and bound with a kiſs? from thence he was carried back to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> firſt to <hi>Annas,</hi> then to <hi>Caiphas,</hi> and, (as late as it was) there he was examined, and buffeted, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over to the cuſtody of thoſe officers, from whom he received all thoſe irr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In which compaſs fell that <hi>Gallicinium,</hi> that crowing of the Cock, which called up <hi>Peter</hi> to his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. How thou paſſedſt all that time laſt night, thou knoweſt. If thou didſt any thing then that needed <hi>Peters</hi> tears, and haſt not ſhed them, let me be thy Cock, do it now; now thy Maſter, (in the unworthyeſt of his ſervants) looks back upon thee, Do it now.

him, &amp; then carried him to <hi>Pilate,</hi> who was to be his Judg. Didſt thou accuſe thy ſelf when thou wak'dſt this morning, &amp; waſt thou content to admit even falſ accuſations, that is, rather to ſuſpect actions to have been ſin which were not, then to ſmother &amp; juſtifie ſuch as were tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſins? then thou ſpendſt that hour in conformity to him. <hi>Pilat</hi> found no evidence againſt him; &amp; therefore to eaſe himſelf, &amp; to paſs a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement upon <hi>Herod,</hi> Tetrarch of <hi>Galilee,</hi> who was at that time at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> (becauſe Chriſt being a <hi>Galilean</hi> was of <hi>Herods</hi> juriſdiction) <hi>Pilat</hi> ſent him to <hi>Herod;</hi> &amp; rather as a mad man, then a malefactor, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> remanded him with ſcorns to <hi>Pilat</hi> to proceed againſt him; &amp; this was about 8 of the Clock. Haſt thou been content to come to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, this examination, this agitation, this cribration, this purſuit of thy conſcience, to ſift it, to follow it from the ſins of thy youth to thy preſent ſins, from the ſins of thy bed to the ſins of thy board, and from the ſubſtance to the circumſtance of thy ſins; that's time ſpent like thy Saviours, <hi>Pilat</hi> would have ſav'd Chriſt by uſing the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the day in his behalf, becauſe that day one priſoner was to be delivered; but they choſe <hi>Barrabas.</hi> He would have ſav'd him from death, by ſatisfying their fury, with inflicting other torments upon him, ſcourging, and crowning with thorns, &amp; loading him with many ſcornful &amp; ignominious contumelies; but this redeem'd him not; they preſs'd a crucifying. Haſt thou gone about to redeem thy ſin, by faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by alms, by diſciplines, &amp; mortifications, in the way of ſatisfaction to the juſtice of God; that will not ſerve, that's not the right way. We preſs an utter crucifying of that ſin that governs thee, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms thee to Chriſt. Towards noon <hi>Pilat</hi> gave Judgment; and they made ſuch haſt to execution, as that by noon he was upon the Croſs. There now hangs that ſacred body upon the croſs, re-baptiz'd in his own tears &amp; ſweat, and embalm'd in his own blood alive. There are thoſe bowels of compaſſion, which are ſo conſpicuous, ſo manifeſted, as that you may ſee them through his wounds. There thoſe glorious eyes grew faint in their light, ſo, as the Sun aſham'd to ſurvive them, departed with his light too. And there that Son of God, who was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from us, &amp; yet had now come a new way unto us, in aſſuming our nature, delivers that ſoul which was never out of his Fathers hands, into his Fathers hands, by a new way, a voluntary emiſſion thereof; for though to <hi>this God our Lord belong theſe iſſues of death,</hi> ſo that, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his own contract, he muſt neceſſarily dy, yet at no breach, nor battery which they had made upon his ſacred body iſſues his ſoul, but <hi>emiſit,</hi> he gave up the Ghoſt: &amp; as God breath'd a ſoul into the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo this ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> breath'd his ſoul into God, into the hands of God. There we leave you, in that bleſſed dependancy, to hang up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, that hangs upon the croſs. There bath in his tears, there ſuck at his wounds, &amp; lie down in peace in his grave, till he vouchſafe you a Reſurrection, &amp; an aſcenſion into that Kingdome which he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd for you, with the ineſtimable price of his incorruptible blood.</p>
